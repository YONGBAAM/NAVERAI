272,792447,794280,,"We just had a lovely meal,"
273,794282,798051,,the band... is on fire...
274,798053,800119,,and you're sitting next to a beautiful woman
275,800121,801838,,wearing whorish makeup.
276,803140,805124,,Why don't we head out on the dance floor
277,805126,807560,,and see if I can sweat through these dress shields.
278,807562,811047,,"Once again, I-I'm really not much of a dancer."
279,811049,812565,,Don't worry...
280,812567,815185,,I'll lead.
281,815187,817437,,"(""The Chicken Dance"" playing)"
282,839543,842762,,(imitating lightsaber)
283,845967,847133,,Howard?
284,847135,849886,,(imitates lightsaber turning off)
285,849888,851521,,Ready for bed?
286,851523,853940,,"No. I need to brush my teeth, but your moth's"
287,853942,856175,,"been in the bathroom for, like, an hour."
288,856177,860730,,"Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on."
289,860732,862148,,"Ma, give up!"
290,862150,865118,,Tonight's not your night!
291,865120,868288,,MRS. WOLOWITZ: You don't know that! I just sat down!
292,868290,870123,,"WOLOWITZ: Come on, take a break!"
293,870125,872275,,Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!
294,872277,874310,,MRS. WOLOWITZ: She can come in and brush her teeth!
295,874312,877247,,I'm not embarrassed!
296,877249,879549,,Problem solved.
297,881035,883720,,"No, it's not. I'm not going in there."
298,883722,884971,,"Oh, come on, honey."
299,884973,887057,,She's just sitting in there reading a magazine.
300,887059,888258,,You can't see anything.
301,888260,890093,,I go in all the time.
302,890095,891644,,(chuckles)
303,891646,894664,,MRS. WOLOWITZ: Ha! The eagle has landed!
304,894666,896833,,(toilet flushing)
305,898019,900737,,And we have splashdown.
306,900739,902522,,(clears throat)
307,902524,905775,,"Wait here, I'm gonna go light a candle."
308,905777,909412,,And then we make passionate love.
309,915402,917003,,"There we go, last floor."
310,917005,918755,,I just can't figure out what happened.
311,918757,921758,,"I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out,"
312,921760,926129,,"I put my left leg in, and something just snapped."
313,926131,928965,,The hokey pokey is a young man's game.
314,928967,931434,,(chuckles) I did have a great time.
315,931436,932769,,Thank you for reminding me
316,932771,935271,,it's okay to have fun once in a while.
317,935273,936756,,You're welcome.
318,936758,938858,,And also for breaking the head off the ice swan
319,938860,940777,,so I could hold it against my pulled groin.
320,940779,942479,,I excel
321,942481,945431,,"at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the graceful slope"
322,945433,948151,,of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely.
323,949286,952572,,"Well, okay. Again, thank you."
324,952574,955241,,"And again, you're welcome."
325,956043,958495,,Want to come in?
326,958497,960163,,"No, thanks. I'm gonna head home."
327,960165,962332,,"'Kay. Well, good night."
328,962334,964968,,Good night.
329,970858,973292,,"Ames, hi. How was the wedding?"
330,973294,978314,,Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.
331,980568,982485,,"Come in, let's talk."
332,983521,985939,,Do you want a glass of wine?
333,985941,988408,,Wine is one of the reasons I'm in this fix.
334,988410,989859,,That and this dang pelvis.
335,992029,994681,,"Okay, I'm sorry, what exactly happened?"
336,994683,996933,,The inevitable-- he was lonely and vulnerable
337,996935,998434,,"from missing his girlfriend,"
338,998436,999652,,"while I was charming,"
339,999654,1001721,,"supportive and, let's face it, in this dress,"
340,1001723,1005358,,the perfect combination of Madonna and whore.
341,1005360,1008111,,"Oh, God, did he make a move on you?"
342,1008113,1009896,,"No, but it's only a matter of time."
343,1009898,1012582,,How could I have not seen this coming?
344,1012584,1016703,,Now I'm gonna have to break the little sad sack's heart.
345,1016705,1019455,,"Yeah, I'm sure he'll be okay. - Oh, Penny,"
346,1019457,1022342,,much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had
347,1022344,1024010,,"been defiled by the same man,"
348,1024012,1026012,,Leonard just doesn't get my motor running.
349,1029717,1031351,,"So, um, what are you gonna do?"
350,1031353,1034270,,"Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?"
351,1034272,1036639,,No. I'll let him have tonight.
352,1036641,1037724,,"Then in the morning,"
353,1037726,1039526,,I'll send him an e-mail letting him know
354,1039528,1042111,,this body is never gonna be his wonderland.
355,1043614,1046766,,"I mean, frankly, you've got a better shot than he does."
356,1056627,1057944,,Leonard.
357,1057946,1059412,,Check it out.
358,1059414,1061614,,I bought an N-gauge locomotive.
359,1061616,1063716,,Half the size of H-O.
360,1063718,1067220,,"Look, it fits in my mouth."
361,1067222,1069556,,Sounds like you had a   night.
362,1069558,1071624,,(muffled): I did.
363,1071626,1074561,,How was yours? - Not bad. I had a lot more fun
364,1074563,1076295,,with Amy than I thought I would.
365,1076297,1078681,,What exact do you mean by that?
366,1078683,1080266,,"Well, it turns out she really knows"
367,1080268,1083019,,how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time.
368,1083021,1087023,,"Although, truth be told, my groin's a little worse for wear."
369,1087858,1090159,,Ow!
370,1091829,1093746,,Why did you do that?
371,1093748,1097250,,To send a message: she is not for you.
372,1097252,1098651,,What?
373,1098653,1100003,,Not for you!
374,1114916,1117601,,"Good morning, handsome."
375,1117603,1120420,,"Morning, Mom."
376,1121723,1123607,,It's me.
377,1125727,1129429,,"Yes, it is, and you're so pretty in the morning."
378,1131032,1133100,,Your mom and I made you breakfast.
379,1133102,1134485,,"(laughs) Oh, wow."
380,1134487,1136704,,So you guys are getting along?
381,1136706,1138322,,"Yeah, I guess."
382,1138324,1140107,,"We're very different people, Howard,"
383,1140109,1142943,,so communication's a little tricky.
384,1142945,1144829,,MRS. WOLOWITZ: Does he like the pancakes?!
385,1144831,1147131,,He didn't try them yet!
386,1149501,1151285,,Is there any butter?
387,1151287,1153304,,It's butter-flavored syrup. - Oh.
388,1153306,1154972,,"MRS. WOLOWITZ: So, what's the word?!"
389,1154974,1157224,,He wants butter!
390,1158527,1160761,,MRS. WOLOWITZ: It's butter-flavored syrup!
391,1160763,1163430,,I just told him that!
392,1168803,1170771,,I don't need any butter.
393,1170773,1174191,,"If you want butter, I'll get you butter."
394,1177696,1179613,,"Well, I guess I'll cut these by myself."
395,1179615,1239615,,"== sync, corrected by   =="
