159,441288,444606,,That's what you said about   movie.

162,453766,455333,,Can I wear my maid of honor dress?
163,455335,457485,,Seriously? You're going to wear that thing to City Hall?
164,457487,460455,,"It's all I have left! You're going to take that from me, too?!"
165,468147,469764,,"Amy, you look great."
166,469766,471115,,I know.

171,481745,483494,,and they're getting married.
172,483496,486414,,"Shh, no one can know."
173,487566,489751,,Look at all these people in love.
174,489753,491819,,"It kind of gets you thinking, doesn't it?"
175,491821,493888,,"It does, indeed."
176,493890,495340,,Leonard...
177,495342,497342,,is it awkward being here with Penny given that
178,497344,499594,,you recently proposed to her?
179,502147,503681,,You proposed to Penny?
180,503683,505566,,I don't want to talk about it. Where did he pop the question?
181,505568,506759,,What did you say?
182,506784,508520,,"She said, ""No."" Can we drop it now?"
183,508521,509854,,It wasn't a real proposal.
184,509856,511322,,Why wasn't it a real proposal?
185,511324,513307,,He asked her during coitus.
186,515244,517895,,Did you get down on one knee or where you already there?
187,517897,519397,,(chuckles)
188,520833,523451,,"Howard, don't talk like that on your wedding day."
189,523453,524702,,"Sorry, Ma... Bernadette."
190,524704,526871,,Ma... Burna... You're ma Bernadette.
191,528323,530091,,Good move telling Sheldon.

193,532245,534178,,Is there anything else I'm not allowed to do?
194,534180,535763,,"All right, that's enough."
195,535765,537015,,Today is not about you two.
196,537017,540218,,Today is about Howard and Bernadette

209,570282,574168,,I can't believe we're not going to get married.

220,609503,611637,,Froot Loops would be more comfortable

224,618079,621697,,"and when I come back, I have to pick up a poodle crap."
225,624067,625501,,Is that better?
226,627003,629955,,Thanks.
227,631758,633995,,"You know, we could always drive to Vegas and get married."

229,636396,639013,,"Hey, I know tons of people who got married in Vegas."
230,639015,640932,,Are any of them still married?
231,640934,643935,,"Yeah, I mean, not to the same people but..."
232,643937,647855,,There's got to be some place special we could do it.
233,647857,652560,,"Leonard, where did you envision marrying Penny?"
234,653912,656397,,Will you shut up?
235,658333,660168,,"Well, I know how to make it special."
236,660170,662170,,I told you we are not recreating the wedding
237,662172,663704,,from
238,663706,666807,,"Yes, you made that brutally clear to me."
239,668460,671128,,What I was going to suggest is if that you're willing to wait
240,671130,673214,,"until Sunday morning, the Google satellite"
241,673216,674465,,will be over Pasadena.
242,674467,678102,,You can have your wedding photographed from space.
243,678104,679971,,PENNY: Oh... That's so cool.
244,679973,681939,,"Oh, wait to go, Raj. I keep telling you,"
245,681941,683391,,"if I wasn't an astrophysicist,"
246,683393,685259,,I would have been a party planner.

248,686529,688529,,It was always a coin flip.
249,689815,692283,,"Okay, so we know we're going to do it Sunday morning."
250,692285,696187,,Now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us.
251,696189,697805,,How about our roof?
252,697807,700741,,"Oh, I like that. That's great."
253,700743,703160,,"Oh, my gosh. I can't believe my maid of honor dress"
254,703162,704778,,is going to be on Google Earth.
255,706999,708782,,"So, we have the where and the when,"
256,708784,711952,,but we still need to figure out who's going to do the ceremony.
257,711954,713504,,"Well, that's easy. Anyone can go online"
258,713506,714805,,and get ordained as a minister.
259,714807,716924,,"I know a piercing parlor, where, for a hundred bucks,"
260,716926,718626,,they'll marry you and stick a wedding ring

262,721947,724649,,"Great, well, who's it going to be?"
263,724651,726317,,"SHELDON: I'll do it,"
264,726319,730187,,provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon.
265,730189,731689,,No.
266,732908,735109,,What do you see in her?
267,737362,740631,,(speaking Russian)

274,760019,762136,,This happens a lot.
275,762138,764639,,"Nine times out of ten, no problem."
276,764641,767308,,What happens on the tenth time?
277,767310,769560,,Problem.
278,772614,774365,,"Hey, guys, before I forget,"
279,774367,776567,,I got you a little groomsman present.
280,776569,778703,,"Oh, thanks, man. You didn't have to do that."
281,778705,781439,,"Fantastic Four, annual number three from 1965,"
282,781441,782990,,in mint condition.
283,782992,786694,,The one where Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl get married.
284,786696,788129,,"(chuckles) Oh, wow. (chuckles)"
285,788131,790414,,"Oh, dear."
286,791333,793584,,I was afraid of this. What?
287,793586,797588,,"While a thoughtful gift, this comic book in this condition"
288,797590,799724,,is worth at least a hundred dollars.
289,799726,800825,,"Yeah, so?"
290,800827,802209,,I bought you an Bernadette
291,802211,804979,,a gravy boat worth $88.
292,805647,808099,,Which places me in your debt
293,808101,810017,,and I can't be in your debt
294,810019,813371,,because someday you might ask me to help you move...
295,814473,818075,,...or to kill a man.
296,818077,821078,,I doubt he'll ask you to kill a man.
297,821080,822830,,"Well, what if it's his only way out?"
298,822832,823998,,I can't risk it.
299,824000,827702,,Here is $12.
300,829571,831205,,"Now, we're even."
301,831207,832623,,(stammers) Wait...
302,832625,835459,,I bought a card. Give me two dollars.
303,838513,841182,,"And for the record, this is why I hate gift-giving."
304,845637,847021,,AMY: Who is it?
305,847023,848723,,It's the groom.
306,848725,852526,,You can't come in. Bad luck to see the bride.
307,853779,855363,,"Okay, uh, fine."
308,855365,857565,,"Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother!"
309,857567,859200,,I'll be right back!
310,859202,862319,,BERNADETTE: Why can't she drive herself?!
311,862321,864572,,She doesn't want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it
312,864574,867908,,so I'm going to lay her down in the back of my neighbor's van!
313,869277,871328,,"All right, just hurry!"
314,871330,874298,,"Okay, I'll see you later, Ma... uh..."
315,874300,875883,,lovely bride-to-be.
316,877335,880004,,I really got to watch that.
317,885644,887294,,"Come on, Raj, we're ready to start."
318,887296,888763,,"What, we're ready,"
319,888765,892032,,when I say we're ready.
320,892034,893350,,(muttering)
321,893352,895135,,Ooh. (clears throat)
322,895137,898239,,"Okay, now we're ready."
323,898241,902693,,"Ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?!"
324,902695,904111,,MRS. WOLOWITZ: I'm fine where I am!
325,904113,906647,,I don't want to fall off the roof!
326,908617,911285,,You'll fall through the roof before you fall off it.
327,913455,914672,,Penny.
328,915757,918626,,(Vivaldi's   plays)
329,918628,923597,,Your new mother-in-law's a piece of work.
330,923599,925549,,"Not now, Dad."
331,925551,927468,,She's got a bigger mustache than me.
332,929905,932356,,Here you go.
333,933058,934308,,"""Here you go""?"
334,934310,936777,,"What am I, a football?"
335,943368,947705,,Like that guy could catch a football.
336,947707,949557,,"KOOTHRAPPALI: Howard and Bernadette,"
337,949559,952743,,the five of us stand before you as your friends
338,952745,954695,,and newly ordained ministers.
339,954697,957698,,MRS. WOLOWITZ: Louder!
340,957700,960968,,"They all got ordained, they're all marrying us,"
341,960970,962336,,it's adorable!
342,962338,964672,,"If you want to hear it, come closer!"
343,967676,970761,,"Guys, when I look at the two of you"
344,970763,975516,,"starting your lives together, it fills... my heart..."
345,977052,979770,,It fills my... heart... (sobs)
346,979772,981939,,"Okay, I'm going to need a minute."
347,983325,984942,,"Okay, I'll, I'll go. (clears throat)"
348,984944,987328,,"Howard and Bernadette, I know you two"
349,987330,989914,,"planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding,"
350,989916,992283,,"but when you're in love, it doesn't matter where"
351,992285,993617,,or how these things happen.
352,993619,997070,,It just matters that you have each other.
353,997072,1000708,,Hmm.
354,1000710,1003210,,Problem?
355,1003212,1005129,,No.
356,1005131,1007848,,I think the Reverend Hofstadter
357,1007850,1009633,,is making an ironic connection
358,1009635,1012803,,between your statement about love and your rejection
359,1012805,1014421,,of his proposal in the bedroom.
360,1014423,1016993,,"Oh, grow up. Hey, I didn't say it."
361,1016994,1018193,,"All right, that's enough  from the both of you."
362,1023682,1027067,,"Bernadette, I want to thank you"
363,1027069,1029336,,for allowing me to be your maid of honor.
364,1029338,1031372,,"I also want you to know,"
365,1031374,1033290,,that I will be happy to do it again
366,1033292,1036210,,if this marriage craps out.
367,1040465,1043167,,"Thank you, Amy."
368,1043169,1045252,,Very touching.
369,1046321,1048455,,"Howard and Bernadette,"
370,1048457,1051592,,you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other.
371,1051594,1054011,,And that's the strongest kind of love
372,1054013,1059633,,"because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect."
373,1059635,1064521,,Qualities that are   to find in people these days.
374,1068777,1071729,,Would you like some aloe vera?
375,1071731,1073948,,You just got burned.
376,1076117,1078619,,"All right, my turn. (clears throat)"
377,1078621,1082623,,"Howard, Bernadette..."
378,1082625,1085993,,(speaking Klingon)
379,1085995,1089496,,Sheldon! I told you no Klingon!
380,1092867,1094718,,"Fine, I'll do it in English,"
381,1094720,1096470,,but it loses something.
382,1097839,1102192,,"The need to find another human being to share one's life with,"
383,1102194,1104161,,has always puzzled me.
384,1105497,1108983,,Maybe because I'm so interesting all by myself.
385,1110885,1113520,,"With that being said, may you find as much happiness"
386,1113522,1117658,,with each other as I find on my own.
387,1117660,1120360,,The Klingon would have made you cry.
388,1121413,1125249,,I believe you two have prepared vows?
389,1128887,1131755,,"Howard Joel Wolowitz, like you,"
390,1131757,1133874,,this is going to be short and sweet.
391,1135760,1138178,,I love you with all my heart and soul
392,1138180,1141615,,and promise to be with you forever.

394,1149108,1151058,,MRS. WOLOWITZ: Speak up!
395,1151060,1154561,,"Hey, from now on, she's the only women who can yell at me!"
396,1158366,1160734,,"Until I met you,"
397,1160736,1165622,,I couldn't imagine spending my life with just one person...
398,1165624,1166874,,(chuckles)
399,1166876,1169626,,...and now I can't imagine
400,1169628,1172579,,spending one day of it without you.
401,1175750,1177751,,"ALL: By the power vested in us,"
402,1177753,1179670,,by the state of California...
403,1179672,1181388,,and the Klingon High Council...
404,1182924,1187478,,...we now pronounce you husband and wife.
405,1187480,1189897,,(all cheering)
406,1211921,1213539,,That's ignition.
407,1213541,1215908,,I love this part!
408,1215910,1217359,,"Me, too!"
409,1217361,1220862,,I have strongly mixed feelings!
410,1222382,1224817,,"Oh, my God, it's happening."
411,1224819,1225968,,Did I miss it?
412,1225970,1227419,,"No, come on in. Hurry."
413,1227421,1229471,,(rocket engine rumbling on TV)
414,1229473,1231440,,I love that man.
415,1231442,1234209,,"Me, too."
416,1238248,1240199,,I can't believe it.
