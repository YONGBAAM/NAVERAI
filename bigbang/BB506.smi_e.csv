1,4147,7015,,It's called the Born Again Boat Ride.

31,84160,85510,,My mother's fried chicken

42,107233,109200,,"All right, that settles it, we're going out. Do you like sushi?"
43,109202,111836,,There's a great little place down the street.

80,207424,209641,,if you don't mind a mother prying a bit?
81,209643,213178,,"Well, there's actually big news on the Amy front."
82,213180,214634,,She's been studying the

88,228022,229222,,We'll probably never know.
89,230830,235166,,But sometimes it's fun to creep yourself out thinking about it.

91,241091,243958,,I hear you're in some sort of a long distance situation?

96,250934,252917,,"Oh, that's funny turn, isn't it?"
97,252919,257388,,You never think about it going the other way.
98,259475,262610,,"Well, you can't force things."
99,262612,264762,,You need to figure out if you're in a relationship
100,264764,266397,,or if you're just calling it one.

102,268235,271820,,in the oven but that don't make 'em biscuits.
103,271822,273938,,And that reminds me of another saying.
104,273940,276067,,"You can lead a chicken to Crisco, but you can't"
105,276092,277371,,make your mother fry it.

107,282916,286217,,I will put you over my knee right here in this restaurant.
108,287470,290088,,"Please pester her. Please, for me."
109,293642,295977,,"So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?"
110,295979,297228,,It was good.
111,297230,299647,,The only thing that would have made it better
112,299649,301683,,is if it was cooked
113,301685,305019,,and if it was beef.
114,305021,308156,,"Sheldon, when is your landlord going to fix the elevator?"
115,308158,309941,,I don't know.
116,309943,311659,,Lately we've been talking about

118,315115,317248,,Your son seems to think
119,317250,320752,,we need to launch a preemptive strike on Burbank.

121,329845,333381,,"Hey, look who decided to show up."
122,333383,335383,,"Raj, what are you doing?"
123,335385,339721,,I couldn't find you guys so I bought six new friends.
124,340656,344209,,"Three, sadly, are dead."
125,344211,346444,,"Mom, you remember Rajesh?"
126,346446,348563,,"Rajesh, my mother. - Of course."
127,348565,350782,,Mrs. Cooper. So nice to see you again.
128,350784,353318,,"Well, it's so nice to see you, too."
129,355621,357521,,I thought it was our Indians
130,357523,360858,,that had the occasional alcohol problem.
131,362628,364879,,"We don't say that, either."
132,366198,368917,,I'll make you a list.
133,368919,370969,,"Oh, that would be mighty white of you."
134,372871,376674,,"So, Raj, what pain are you trying"
135,376676,378927,,to cover up with alcohol?
136,378929,380678,,"Nothing, I'm fine. - Are ya?"
137,380680,382814,,(sobbing) No.
138,382816,383932,,That's better.
139,383934,385366,,Now tell me what's bothering you.
140,385368,387685,,I'm so lonely.
141,387687,390238,,"Oh, yes, born alone, die alone."
142,390240,392523,,It's a tragic human condition.
143,392525,393575,,"Now, Raj,"
144,393577,394892,,"if you'll excuse my mother,"
145,394894,396694,,she's about to make a pecan pie
146,396696,398580,,that'll be so good I'll almost forget
147,398582,400748,,how she blew it with the fried chicken.
148,400750,402784,,"Sheldon, your friend is hurtin'."
149,402786,404752,,What do we do when someone's hurtin'?
150,404754,407905,,Offer them a hot beverage.
151,407907,409407,,"And when they're drunk as a skunk,"
152,409409,410842,,what beverage do we offer?
153,410844,412927,,Coffee.
154,412929,415263,,And what do we do it with?
155,421537,424755,,Now you listen to me.
156,424757,427775,,"I know you feel like you can't find someone,"
157,427777,429477,,but there's a lock for every key.
158,429479,430862,,"Back home, there's a girl"
159,430864,434282,,"works at the Wal-Mart. Tall, tall girl."
160,434284,437035,,Woman could hunt geese with a rake.
161,437037,438569,,Thought she'd never
162,438571,441789,,"find a man, then one day, wouldn't ya know,"
163,441791,444459,,Harlem Globetrotters come to town.
164,444461,447445,,"Long story short,"
165,447447,449631,,today that woman travels the world
166,449633,451499,,with a semi-professional basketball player
167,451501,454752,,and two beautiful mixed-race babies.
168,454754,459057,,"I didn't get a lot of that because of your accent,"
169,459059,460892,,but the general tone was soothing
170,460894,462793,,and somehow I feel better.
171,464263,468232,,"I'm not going to get my pecan pie, am I?"
172,468234,469967,,You want some Oreos?
173,469969,471602,,"Double Stuf? - No, regular."
174,471604,474355,,Nice. Kick a man when he's down.
175,475491,478443,,"I'm glad we're finally getting to do something together,"
176,478445,480078,,just the two of us.
177,480080,481341,,Sure. One thing you really miss when you're on
178,481366,483085,,vacation is laundry.
179,483700,486284,,"Careful, you're using too much Downey."
180,486286,489037,,You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy.
181,489039,491155,,"Well, this takes me back."
182,491157,494258,,"Me doing your laundry, you next to me criticizing."
183,494260,496210,,"It is nice, isn't it?"
184,496212,498880,,Mrs. Cooper.
185,498882,502500,,"Hi! - Oh, hello, darlin'."
186,502502,504352,,"Sheldon, you didn't tell me your mom was coming."
187,504354,506888,,It was in my weekly e-mail blast.
188,506890,507789,,Right between
189,507791,509857,,"""Beet season is finally here"""
190,509859,514062,,"and ""Uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare."""
191,517032,519033,,"So, how've you been?"
192,519035,520151,,"Good, good."
193,520153,521736,,I hear that Leonard has a new girlfriend.
194,521738,523204,,How are you doing with all that?
195,523206,525206,,"Oh, fine. You know, it's been a while."
196,525208,526824,,I'm getting back out there.
197,526826,529327,,"Let me ask you, when you get back out there,"
198,529329,531913,,are you wearing this?
199,532831,535533,,"Well, it's super cute on."
200,535535,537472,,That top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten
201,537497,538971,,times what it cost.
202,539973,542540,,"Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up"
203,542542,543707,,in promiscuity futures.
204,543709,546010,,"Hon, you think"
205,546012,548763,,maybe the reason why you're having trouble
206,548765,550598,,finding a guy to settle down with
207,550600,552934,,is because you're letting them ride the roller coaster
208,552936,555052,,without buying a ticket?
209,555054,558906,,"Oh, they don't always get to ride the roller coaster."
210,558908,562944,,Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups.
211,565714,567498,,Now I'm going out tonight. Would it be crazy
212,567500,569834,,to ask you to look at the outfit I'm going to wear?
213,569836,571735,,"Oh, not crazy at all."
214,571737,573037,,And don't beat yourself up.
215,573039,575790,,"When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride"
216,575792,577575,,and a bottle of strawberry wine.
217,582064,585883,,That will not be in this week's e-mail blast.
218,587002,588719,,"So, this spring, I get to go"
219,588721,591589,,to the International Space Station.
220,591591,595643,,"Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens."
221,596779,598980,,"If you ever want to live there eternally,"
222,598982,601282,,I've got a good book you could read.
223,601284,604202,,"Thanks, but I watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special"
224,604204,606120,,"every year, so I get the gist."
225,606122,608489,,I bet your mom is really proud of you.
226,608491,609791,,Nope.
227,609793,611375,,She says if I don't back out
228,611377,613327,,she's going to go on a hunger strike.
229,613329,614829,,It would take years before
230,614831,617498,,"she'd be in any kind of danger, but still."
231,617500,620384,,"I've got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom."
232,620386,621636,,I'm taking you
233,621638,624388,,to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture
234,624390,626424,,about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology.
235,626426,627758,,"And the best part is,"
236,627760,629644,,"at the Q and A afterward,"
237,629646,631179,,"I've worked up a couple of ""Q's"""
238,631181,634065,,"that will stump his sorry ""A."""
239,635100,636734,,"I don't know, Shelly."
240,636736,638853,,I thought we could do a little sightseeing.
241,638855,641472,,What sight is better than your little boy
242,641474,643875,,embarrassing a Nobel laureate?
243,643877,645976,,"Come on, Sheldon, we'll take your mom"
244,645978,647662,,"to see the Hollywood sign,"
245,647664,649480,,"the wax museum, the Walk of Fame."
246,649482,651616,,"Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive."
247,651618,654785,,"Well, I can't spend $12,000 on a handbag,"
248,654787,656654,,but it's free to look upon those
249,656656,659157,,who do with righteous condemnation.
250,660792,662093,,What do you say?
251,662095,664178,,What do I say?
252,664180,666964,,I say you people need to stop ruining my mom's visit
253,666966,670935,,"with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts."
254,670937,673104,,Stop it.
255,676358,679644,,He's not talking about your shirt. Your shirt is fine.
256,686907,688656,,These are delicious.
257,688657,690941,,The trick to pancakes is bacon grease.
258,690943,693193,,I cook everything in it.
259,693195,695996,,Everything? Aren't you worried about your health?
260,695998,698331,,"Oh, doctors are always changing their mind."
261,698333,700033,,One week bacon grease is bad for you.
262,700035,702919,,The next week we're not getting enough of it.
263,703955,706206,,"Good morning, Shelly."
264,706208,710176,,"Mom, I want to apologize for my behavior last night."
265,710178,712545,,Apology accepted. - Great.
266,712547,714497,,"Now, you're going to love the Perlmutter lecture."
267,714499,717517,,"Look, he will be stating that the universe is older"
268,717519,719135,,"than 6,000 years, but I thought"
269,719137,720804,,you could stick your fingers in your ears
