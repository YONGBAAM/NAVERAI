11,40797,42197,,Did you have fun doing it?

281,782229,784763,,"You suck, Siwi."
282,784765,786264,,"Hey, don't talk to her like that."
283,786266,787683,,She's a lady.
284,787685,790852,,"Well, that wady took high-wes pictures"
285,790854,793221,,of my junk wast night for Cwaigswist.
286,793223,794890,,Waiter.
287,798828,801079,,PENNY: It's open.
288,801948,803332,,Hey.
289,803334,804282,,You ready to go?
290,804284,805417,,"Yeah, hang on."
291,805419,807653,,Let me just finish this chapter.
292,807655,809037,,Can you finish it later?
293,809039,810422,,"No, I can't."
294,810424,814092,,"Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know,"
295,814094,818246,,we'd have more fun things to talk about if I read more.
296,820583,822801,,Great. Good. Great.
297,822803,824269,,What are you reading?
298,824271,827305,,
299,827307,829107,,They kind of spoil the ending
300,829109,831476,,"right in the name of that, don't they?"
301,832311,833695,,All right.
302,833697,836348,,"Look, just remember how this works."
303,836350,838884,,We don't get mad about these things.
304,838886,840369,,"Uh, speaking of which, I've addressed"
305,840371,842454,,your bug report on my date planning.
306,842456,844289,,Got a really fun evening for you.
307,844291,845590,,It's kind of a surprise.
308,845592,847275,,All right. Terrific.
309,847277,850162,,"Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren't so tall."
310,850164,852214,,We wouldn't want you to feel like you were
311,852216,854566,,out for a walk with your mommy.
312,857119,859254,,Thank you. Yeah.
313,859256,860622,,Oh.
314,860624,863008,,Here's my list for you-- right there.
315,864043,865877,,(clears throat)
316,869098,872184,,"All right, fair enough."
317,872186,875303,,I certainly can be quieter when we kiss.
318,876239,878240,,"I thought it was an expression of passion,"
319,878242,880709,,"but if it's coming across as ""juicy and weird,"""
320,880711,882861,,who wants that?
321,886132,887982,,"Uh, uh... I'm sorry."
322,887984,892087,,"Can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are ""stupid""?"
323,896158,898977,,"Na, never mind. It's right here."
324,901180,902931,,Good timing.
325,902933,904099,,Dinner's almost ready.
326,904101,905350,,Great.
327,905352,907168,,"Oh, smells amazing in here."
328,907170,908503,,"Oh, what are we eating?"
329,908505,910021,,"Oh, an exotic little treat."
330,910023,912557,,"I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck,"
331,912559,914976,,"and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers,"
332,914978,917846,,two of which were fairly close to me.
333,917848,920031,,Her spontaneity is contagious.
334,921567,923535,,Who's Siri?
335,923537,924870,,Is he dating somebody new?
336,924872,927706,,Yes. His phone.
337,927708,930024,,Oh.
338,930026,932544,,Is that cute or creepy?
339,932546,935046,,Uh-huh.
340,936499,937949,,Can I pour you some wine?
341,937951,939084,,I think you'll enjoy it.
342,939086,940302,,The traditional choice
343,940304,942337,,"with Peking duck is a sauvignon blanc,"
344,942339,945340,,but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling.
345,945342,946508,,"I wasn't sure,"
346,946510,948426,,but I didn't want to have an argument
347,948428,950762,,with her in the middle of Trader Joe's.
348,953099,957886,,"Now, what should we put Siri in for dinner?"
349,957888,961606,,"Leopard, sparkles, or"
350,961608,963992,,"to paraphrase Coco Chanel,"
351,963994,967696,,you can never go wrong with a little black case?
352,970917,973335,,"(chimes) Siri, play some smooth jazz."
353,973337,976054,,(chimes) Playing smooth jazz.
354,976056,978223,,(Kenny G music playing)
355,979025,982260,,"Oh, my God, Kenny G?!"
356,982262,984963,,This woman can read me like a book.
357,986232,988366,,I can't believe I bought my soul mate
358,988368,990585,,at Glendale Galleria.
359,995474,998593,,(whispering): I don't know if I want to stay.
360,1001447,1003815,,(gunfire)
361,1007987,1009437,,This is amazing.
362,1009439,1011156,,How did you even get this idea?
363,1011158,1012324,,I called your dad.
364,1012326,1013575,,I asked him what things
365,1013577,1015710,,you liked to do when you were a kid.
366,1015712,1017996,,This seemed easier than getting a cow out here
367,1017998,1020298,,so you could tip it.
368,1022385,1024803,,"Okay, you're kind of really great."
369,1024805,1026338,,You mean for a person whose neck massages
370,1026340,1029507,,feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?
371,1030343,1031877,,"Okay, bug report."
372,1031879,1033061,,I just complimented you.
373,1033063,1034713,,You should take it and shut up.
374,1034715,1035981,,"Right. Sorry, sorry."
375,1035983,1037482,,And stop apologizing all the time.
376,1037484,1039684,,Right. Sorry.
377,1039686,1041236,,"All right, let's shoot stuff."
378,1041238,1043321,,You want me to show you what to do?
379,1043323,1046024,,I play a lot of
380,1046026,1048743,,I think I know how to handle a gat.
381,1048745,1051446,,Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta.
382,1051448,1053448,,(gunshot) (yells)
383,1053450,1055817,,Ooh! (yelling)
384,1056702,1058336,,(whining)
385,1059505,1061706,,(panting)
386,1063793,1066160,,"So, I've got a gunshot wound."
387,1067546,1070181,,That's pretty bad-ass.
388,1070183,1072851,,"No, you've got a Reebok with a gunshot wound"
389,1072853,1074853,,and an ouchie on your pinkie toe.
390,1074855,1076855,,(laughs)
391,1076857,1078974,,Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid.
392,1078976,1080341,,Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids
393,1080343,1081893,,unless it is medically necessary.
394,1081895,1083211,,That is the law.
395,1083213,1085513,,(laughs)
396,1085515,1088450,,"Well, thank you for a really cool evening."
397,1088452,1090518,,Thank you for hiding my   socks
398,1090520,1092537,,at the emergency room.
399,1092539,1094355,,(laughs)
400,1094357,1097325,,Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test
401,1097327,1098910,,and see where we stand?
402,1098912,1101413,,Things are looking good.
403,1101415,1103131,,"So, are we still taking things slow?"
404,1103133,1104499,,"Because a gunshot wound today,"
405,1104501,1107252,,"and last week, I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer."
406,1107254,1109454,,We don't know how much time I have.
