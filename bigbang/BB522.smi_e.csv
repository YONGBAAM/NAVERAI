3,19483,20900,,"Fine, I'll tell you."
4,22086,24504,,"A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species,"
5,24506,26122,,fungi and algae.
6,26124,27707,,"If you could merge with another species,"
7,27709,30877,,what species would you pick and why?
8,30879,33463,,Hint: There is a right answer.
9,34832,36415,,None of you will get it.
10,37851,41637,,"Okay, I'd pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid"
11,41639,43806,,would have the advanced industrial civilization
12,43808,46275,,of a human and the long graceful neck
13,46277,48427,,I've always dreamed of having.
14,49680,52365,,Wrong. Leonard?
15,52367,56235,,"Horse, but mostly just for the height."
16,56237,59155,,A little bit for the genital girth.
17,60324,62441,,"Wrong, and let's keep it clean, shall we?"
18,63911,65078,,"Kangaroo, uh,"
19,65080,67080,,I'd be Kanga-Jew.
20,67082,68464,,(chuckles)
21,68466,71667,,The first of my people to dunk a basketball. (chuckles)
22,71669,73970,,"Also instead of just living in your mother's house,"
23,73972,76839,,you could actually live inside her body.
24,76841,78791,,(mocking laugh)
25,80127,82178,,"Clever, but also wrong."
26,82180,84797,,"No, the best organism for human beings to merge with"
27,84799,86349,,is the lichen itself.
28,86351,89736,,"That way, you'd be human, fungus, and algae."
29,89738,91303,,Triple threat.
30,91305,94306,,Like three-bean salad.
31,94308,96893,,Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.

36,105537,107486,,growing out of a towering maple tree.
37,107488,109705,,"And no thank you, expensive concessions."
38,109707,113426,,"Because as an algae, I'll just snack on this sunlight."
39,114278,116863,,"He got us again. - No, he didn't."
40,116865,119098,,"Anyway, if it's okay with you,"
41,119100,121801,,we should talk about Howard's bachelor party.
42,121803,122802,,"Oh, oh."
43,122804,124670,,Seems like a bit of a letdown
44,124672,126172,,"after our lichen conversation, but..."
45,126174,128441,,"What do you know, you're half swan."
46,129676,131360,,I've been doing some research on strippers.
47,131362,134030,,"One agency I spoke to, said I could get us a great price"
48,134032,137784,,if we're flexible on age range and number of limbs.
49,138819,140519,,"Sounds like loads of fun,"
50,140521,143573,,but I promised Bernadette no strippers.
51,143575,145708,,You don't want strippers? You're the king of strippers.
52,145710,149162,,The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you.
53,149164,152582,,What can I tell ya-- I'm not into that stuff anymore.
54,152584,154300,,"Good for you, Howard. I'm proud of you."
55,154302,156586,,"And still, you're the first one of use to get married."
56,156588,158087,,We have to do something special.
57,158089,160923,,You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom--
58,160925,164010,,"Well, it's probably not for me."
59,166430,168714,,Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley.
60,168716,170082,,They've got that wine train.
61,170084,171517,,"Boo, wine!"
62,171519,173903,,"But yay, trains. I'm in."
63,173905,176856,,"Anyway, it's a beautiful time of year."
64,176858,178908,,"Uh, you travel through the vineyards."
65,178910,180109,,There's a tasting on board.
66,180111,182745,,And all the wildflowers are in bloom.
67,182747,184831,,Magic.

88,237032,239015,,"I mean, even if there was a stripper,"

274,707585,709819,,(laughs)
275,709821,713489,,Ooh! This grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper.
276,713491,716992,,"Okay, okay, when I first came to this country,"
277,716994,720496,,"I-I didn't know how to behave or how to dress,"
278,720498,723382,,or what was cool... I was pretty lonely.
279,723384,727169,,"But then I met Howard, and suddenly, my life changed,"
280,727171,731057,,because we could be lonely together.
281,734344,738147,,This man became my whole world.
282,738149,740700,,"Yeah, nice speech, Francine."
283,744354,747740,,"I'm not done, but thank you."
284,747742,750025,,I think back....
285,752462,754881,,"...to all the good times we had, like, uh,"
286,754883,757032,,when we went camping and spent that night
287,757034,758751,,telling each other all our secrets.
288,758753,761704,,I told him I'm addicted to pedicures
289,761706,764924,,and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin.
290,764926,768060,,(all laugh)
291,768062,770980,,She was my second cousin.
292,770982,772732,,And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually.
293,772734,775101,,Ba-da-bazinga!
294,775103,777887,,"Oh... oh, yeah, and then there was the time"
295,777889,781157,,when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas
296,781159,784994,,and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish
297,784996,788998,,and that she wanted his little kosher pickle.
298,789000,790900,,(all laugh)
299,790902,793035,,"Of all the ""Howard humping hookers"" stories,"
300,793037,795204,,that one's my favorite!
301,795206,797740,,"Okay, buddy, that's it. Sit down."
302,797742,800676,,"Oh, oh, what about that tubby girl"
303,800678,803212,,in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?
304,804381,806265,,Don't remember. Please sit down.
305,806267,809051,,"The only threesome I've ever had in my life,"
306,809053,812355,,and I'm proud to say it was with this man right here.
307,812357,815808,,(all laugh)
308,815810,817526,,"Oh, please shut up."
309,817528,818978,,"Oh, oh, don't get me wrong,"
310,818980,821147,,nothing happened with me and Howard.
311,821149,824734,,There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us.
312,824736,826152,,(laughter)
313,828538,833759,,"Oh, Internet, this is so going all over you."
314,833761,836946,,"Jeepers, I'm drunk. (both laugh)"
315,846742,848506,,Thank you for picking us up.
316,848508,850609,,"There's a warning, right there, on the scotch bottle."
317,850611,853145,,(Scottish accent): You cannot be operatin' heavy machinery
318,853147,856281,,"after you had a snootful of this, laddie!"
319,856283,860569,,(both laughing)
320,861071,863405,,Funny.
321,863407,865156,,You boys have a nice time?
322,865158,867258,,"Yeah, it was great."
323,867260,868376,,"Low-key, like I promised."
324,868378,870578,,"No hanky-panky, no strippers."
325,870580,874249,,Just the guys telling jokes.
326,874251,876418,,That's nice.
327,876420,879888,,How about you? Did you have a fun night?
328,879890,882891,,"Yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine,"
329,882893,885643,,and then went online and saw this.
330,885645,889380,,"KOOTHRAPPALI: Of all the ""Howard humping hookers"" stories,"
331,889382,891099,,that one's my favorite.
332,896489,898606,,"You know, we're not that far from my apartment."
333,898608,901860,,"If you stop the car, I can walk from here."
334,901862,905397,,"You ain't goin' anywhere, Threeway."
335,905399,908616,,"Bernadette, listen... You lied to me."
336,908618,911119,,"You said you told me about all the girls you've been with,"
337,911121,915707,,"but you never mentioned your cousin, the prostitute or Raj!"
338,915709,919294,,"Seriously, you don't even have to stop the car."
339,919296,920912,,Anything under ten miles an hour
340,920914,922914,,and I can combat-roll into the street.
341,925301,927552,,"Okay, just to set the record straight,"
342,927554,931940,,"I didn't hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him."
343,931942,933308,,"Shame on you, Raj."
344,933310,935927,,That is not how we treat women in this country.
345,937446,939481,,Don't you try and blame this on him.
346,939483,941733,,"Thank you, Bernadette. - Zip it, pervert!"
347,945037,947405,,I don't know what I'm going to do.
348,947407,949524,,I'm supposed to marry Howard in a couple weeks
349,949526,952460,,and I'm not sure I even know who the man is anymore.
350,952462,954796,,I'm curious what's bothering you most:
351,954798,957999,,"the borderline incest, the prostitute or group sex"
352,958001,960969,,with the girl dressed as the children's cartoon?
353,961837,963972,,"Amy, remember when we went over things"
354,963974,966007,,that would be helpful and things that wouldn't?
355,966009,967642,,Right.
356,967644,969928,,And that was... - Not.
357,971814,974399,,"When I first met Howard, he seemed so innocent to me,"
358,974401,976801,,just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother.
359,976803,978803,,"Well, if that's what you like, I'll take you"
360,978805,981322,,to the comic book store-- the place is full of 'em.
361,982258,984692,,Wait a minute.
362,984694,986811,,You set me up with Howard.
363,987413,988413,,Did you know about
364,988415,990148,,all the creepy stuff he was into?
365,990150,992534,,"Well, a little. You hear stuff..."
366,995070,997071,,Why didn't you tell me
367,997073,998256,,"Well, I was gonna, but I didn't think"
368,998258,999908,,it would go past the first date.
369,999910,1001793,,"Then, when it did, I thought for sure"
370,1001795,1003461,,it wouldn't go past you meeting his mother.
371,1003463,1005380,,Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together.
372,1005382,1010101,,"I mean, the warning signs were there-- this is really on you."
373,1010103,1010919,,God!
374,1010921,1012720,,I thought you were my friend.
375,1012722,1015156,,(crying)
376,1015158,1016808,,(sighs)
377,1016810,1018526,,(door slams)
378,1018528,1020178,,I don't think that was helpful.
379,1022948,1025066,,"Hi, Bernie, it's me again."
380,1025068,1027285,,Please call me back.
381,1027287,1029737,,"Dude, I am so sorry."
382,1029739,1032023,,"It's not your fault, it's mine."
383,1032025,1034409,,"I did all that stuff, not you."
384,1034411,1037361,,"Actually, you did do one of them together."
385,1038414,1040197,,Here.
386,1040199,1041282,,What is this?
387,1041284,1042366,,You're upset.
388,1042368,1043334,,The convention is to
389,1043336,1045003,,bring an upset person a hot beverage.
390,1045005,1046621,,"No, but what is it?"
391,1046623,1047555,,Chicken broth.
392,1047557,1050008,,It seemed culturally appropriate.
393,1051227,1053011,,"Also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon"
394,1053013,1054596,,in the cupboard when I moved in
395,1054598,1058099,,and it's been bothering me for the last eight years...
396,1058101,1060318,,"So, as they say, two birds."
397,1061937,1064439,,I don't know what my next move is.
398,1064441,1067275,,"Well, Howard, I don't know much about women..."
399,1067277,1069561,,"Yeah? - No, uh, that, that's it."
400,1069563,1071713,,I don't know much about women.
401,1073115,1074816,,"Raj, you got anything?"
402,1074818,1078069,,I've got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.
403,1080072,1082757,,I'm not calling the girl from Comic-con.
404,1082759,1084008,,All right.
405,1084010,1086461,,More Sailor Moon for me.
406,1088430,1091082,,I just threw up the bachelor party.
407,1094270,1095853,,"Please come out, Bernadette."
408,1095855,1097355,,Let's talk through this.
409,1097357,1098840,,"BERNADETTE: No, leave me alone."
410,1098842,1102393,,Perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine.
411,1102395,1104279,,Do you have a cousin who you find attractive?
412,1104281,1107682,,(knocking on door) Amy.
413,1107684,1109367,,"Hey, you introduced him to the sleazebag."
414,1109369,1111936,,I'm just trying to clean up your mess.
415,1113605,1115056,,"Oh, hi."
416,1115058,1116207,,Hi.
417,1116209,1118293,,I need to talk to Bernadette.
418,1118295,1121612,,"Well, I don't think she wants to talk to anyone right now."
419,1121614,1125967,,"All right, well, could you at least give her a message?"
420,1125969,1127785,,"Yeah, sure, I guess."
421,1127787,1131589,,Tell her I'm really sorry.
422,1131591,1136928,,"And if she doesn't want to marry me, I get it."
423,1136930,1139347,,But what I really want her to know
424,1139349,1141632,,"is the guy that she's disgusted by,"
425,1141634,1143768,,"is the guy that I'm disgusted by, too."
426,1143770,1146821,,But that guy doesn't exist anymore; he's gone.
427,1146823,1151909,,And the reason is because of her.
428,1151911,1157332,,"So, if this relationship is over,"
429,1157334,1161452,,"let her know that she made me a better man,"
430,1161454,1165923,,and tell her thank you.
431,1165925,1169727,,"(voice breaking): Oh, my God, Howard."
432,1169729,1174265,,That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
433,1174267,1178436,,And it came out of you.
434,1179421,1182106,,Howie?
435,1182108,1185360,,Penny has a message for you.
436,1185362,1187278,,I heard.
437,1187280,1190765,,"Your voice, not unlike your mother's, travels through walls."
438,1190767,1193234,,Do you want me to go?
439,1193236,1194819,,No.
440,1195354,1196687,,Come here.
441,1202027,1203828,,I'm still really mad at you.
442,1203830,1205696,,I get that.
443,1205698,1208332,,Is there anything else about your past I should know?
444,1208334,1211169,,"Couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas."
445,1211171,1213337,,I'll tell you later.
446,1215174,1216491,,Okay.
447,1216493,1218843,,"So, is the wedding still on?"
448,1218845,1222180,,"Yeah, the wedding's still on."
449,1223716,1225633,,"(laughing): Oh, thank God."
450,1225635,1228369,,I'm still a maid of honor!
451,1229721,1232273,,"Oh, what the hell."
452,1233192,1235426,,AMY: This is kind of hot.
453,1245525,1247859,,Hello.
454,1247861,1249711,,What's with the robe?
455,1249713,1252080,,"I'm gonna have sex with you right here,"
456,1252082,1254299,,"right now, on that washing machine."
457,1257220,1259071,,"No, you're not."
458,1259073,1262090,,"Come on, please."
459,1263593,1265043,,"If you want to do something,"
460,1265045,1267446,,you can help me fold this sheet.
461,1268765,1271316,,"Folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy."
462,1271318,1331318,,"== sync, corrected by   =="
