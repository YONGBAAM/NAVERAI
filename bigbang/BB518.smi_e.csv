1,4306,5339,,I'll pick you up when you're done.
2,5341,6790,,Okay.
3,6792,9665,,"I like it a little better when you stay, but all right."
4,9666,10864,,"Hey, Sheldon."
5,10866,12700,,Hello. I'm here for my haircut
6,12702,14034,,with Mr. D'Onofrio.
7,14036,15970,,"I'm sorry, Uncle Tony's in the hospital."
8,15972,17171,,He's pretty sick.
9,17173,21008,,"Oh, dear, Mr. D'Onofrio's in the hospital."
10,21010,23578,,Why do these things always happen to me?
11,24379,25563,,I can cut it for you.
12,25565,27448,,You're not Mr. D'Onofrio.
13,28267,30351,,I get my hair cut by Mr. D'Onofrio.
14,30353,31652,,You believe this guy?
15,31654,32853,,(murmurs)
16,33555,34888,,Excuse us for a second.
17,34890,36407,,"Sheldon, it's okay, he can do it."
18,36409,37525,,He's a barber.
19,37527,40328,,"He's not a barber, he's the nephew."
20,40330,41862,,He's an example of the kind
21,41864,45166,,of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry.
22,45168,46834,,"Besides, Mr. D'Onofrio knows"
23,46836,49403,,exactly how I like my hair done because he has
24,49405,52607,,all my haircut records from my barber in Texas.
25,52609,54408,,What are you talking about?
26,54410,55543,,"When I first moved here,"
27,55545,58179,,"I was nervous about finding a new barber,"
28,58181,60097,,so my mother had all my haircut records
29,60099,62249,,sent here to Mr. D'Onofrio.
30,63251,66721,,There's no such thing as haircut records.
31,66723,69523,,"Yes, there are."
32,69525,70725,,Have you ever seen them?
33,70727,73294,,"No, but my mother assured me they were sent here,"
34,73296,75112,,and I'll bet you dollars to donuts
35,75114,76714,,that this one doesn't have them.
36,77282,78549,,"Uh, excuse me."
37,78551,81152,,Do you have access to my haircut records?
38,81154,82787,,Your what?
39,82789,84605,,"To paraphrase T.S. Eliot,"
40,84607,86123,,this is the way the world ends--
41,86125,89126,,not with a bang but with a nephew.
42,90329,93381,,"Sheldon, you're a grown man, he's a professional,"
43,93383,97301,,and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946.
44,97303,99119,,Just sit down
45,99121,100137,,and let him do it.

116,297517,300735,,I'm looking for a barber and I'm running out of time.
117,300737,301836,,My hair is growing at the rate

121,312532,313531,,I tried once.
122,313533,314849,,They do men's and women's hair
123,314851,317251,,in the same room at the same time.
124,317253,320221,,It's like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.

144,371791,375109,,I got to experience zero gravity.
145,375111,376394,,Cool. How do they do that?
146,376396,377395,,It's pretty neat.
147,377397,378629,,You get in this plane
148,378631,382650,,"that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds,"
149,382652,387288,,"and then straight back down like it's going to crash, and"
150,387290,388573,,they do it
151,388575,390575,,"over and over again, you know,"
152,390577,392776,,no matter how many times you throw up.
153,392778,394612,,You threw up?
154,394614,398166,,"Yeah... and the craziest part is, because there's no gravity,"
155,398168,402920,,the throw-up kind of floats there...
156,402922,404121,,"in a little ball,"
157,404123,405606,,and
158,405608,409143,,if your mouth is open because you're screaming...
159,410712,413898,,...sometimes it just floats right back in.
160,413900,415283,,(laughing)
161,417135,420354,,"Boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens."
162,420356,421355,,That sounds mean.
163,421357,422406,,No.
164,422408,423908,,"Yeah, I would have laughed, too,"
165,423910,426077,,but I didn't want the vomit to come back out.
166,426079,429113,,(laughs)
167,429115,431082,,Anyway...
168,431084,432983,,"Oh, could you do me a favor"
169,432985,436337,,and overnight me some more underwear?
170,436339,437655,,"Sure, why?"
171,437657,439040,,I got a look at the centrifuge
172,439042,440741,,"they're going to spin me around in tomorrow,"
173,440743,443110,,and I have a hunch I packed a little light.
174,443112,445046,,(chuckles nervously)
175,451186,453854,,Mr. D'Onofrio?
176,453856,455640,,It's Sheldon.
177,456475,458392,,They didn't have anything barber-themed
178,458394,462146,,"in the gift shop, so I got you this."
179,462148,464181,,I don't know if you can read his little T-shirt.
180,464183,467201,,"It says, um, ""Get well bear-y soon."""
181,468787,470955,,"Trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now,"
182,470957,471989,,you'd be laughing.
183,471991,473207,,(laughs)
184,474910,478212,,Anyway...
185,478214,482883,,"There's new studies that show, people in comas are aware"
186,482885,485202,,of everything going on around them.
187,485204,488256,,"With that in mind, if you can hear me,"
188,488258,490174,,move away from the light
189,490176,493978,,and toward the sound of these scissors.
190,493980,495062,,(door opens)
191,495064,496731,,Can I help you?
192,496733,497982,,Yes.
193,497984,501936,,Do you have something I could use as a cape?
194,501938,504555,,"Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills,"
195,504557,508159,,"slip out of the ninth floor, and go on a little adventure?"
196,508161,510161,,"Oh, no,"
197,510163,513230,,"no, I'm just here to get my hair cut."
198,516001,517952,,I-I see.
199,517954,520921,,J-Jus-Just wait here one moment.
200,520923,522957,,Security!
201,522959,525576,,I got to run.
202,525578,528796,,But not with scissors-- that would be unsafe.
203,537919,542238,,"So, if I move my horsey here..."
204,544124,547243,,...isn't that checkmate and I win?
205,553601,555351,,Hmm.
206,556153,559055,,"Well, is it or isn't it?"
207,560090,562959,,"You know, I think this is a good stopping point."
208,563928,565895,,"Uh, it's your first real game."
209,565897,567730,,I threw a lot of information at you.
210,567732,568898,,"Well, no,"
211,568900,570266,,"I mean, your king is trapped."
212,570268,573069,,"He can't go here because of my lighthouse,"
213,573071,575771,,and...
214,575773,579909,,he can't go here because of my pointy-head guy.
215,580794,583746,,"Like I said, complicated game."
216,583748,585965,,So did I win or not?
217,585967,587250,,Did you have fun?
218,587252,589052,,"Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner."
219,589054,591337,,"That's, that-that's what chess is all about."
220,592590,594007,,Hello.
221,594009,595008,,"Hey. - Oh, hey."
222,595010,596392,,"Sorry, Sheldon, I'll move. Eh, why?"
223,596394,600280,,"My spot, your spot-- what difference does it make?"
224,603767,606269,,"Okay, what just happened?"
225,606271,607637,,I don't know.
226,607639,609739,,Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer
227,609741,612692,,"and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot,"
228,612694,615078,,"I'm guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug,"
229,615080,617647,,and changed the course of human events.
230,618482,621000,,"Uh, sweetie, are you all right?"
231,621002,623503,,"No, I'm not all right."
232,623505,626205,,It's been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut
233,626207,628625,,and nothing horrible has happened.
234,628627,631678,,"Okay, I'm sorry, I don't understand."
235,631680,633296,,"Leonard, explain it to her."
236,633298,636466,,"Oh, uh, he's crazy."
237,637635,639352,,I have spent my whole life
238,639354,641554,,trying to bring order to the universe
239,641556,644507,,by carefully planning every moment of every day.
240,644509,645675,,But all my efforts--
241,645677,648111,,"our dinner schedule, my pajama rotation,"
242,648113,650346,,my bowel movement spreadsheet--
243,650348,652848,,"it's clear now,"
244,652850,654651,,I've been wasting my time.
245,654653,658988,,Good. I'm taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.
246,658990,661541,,"You know, Sh-Sheldon,"
247,661543,663293,,sometimes it's nice not knowing what's coming.
248,663295,664627,,"I mean, look at me and Leonard."
249,664629,666829,,"We went out, we broke up, now we're trying again."
250,666831,668197,,We don't know what's gonna happen.
251,668199,671050,,"Oh, please, everyone knows what's going to happen."
252,672703,674704,,But I see your point.
253,674706,676339,,I think this could be good for you.
254,676341,678925,,Maybe it's time for you to shake things up a bit.
255,678927,681094,,You're right.
256,681096,683346,,I should embrace the chaos.
257,683348,685098,,Great.

259,686568,687600,,I don't know.
260,687602,689068,,I could do anything.

268,724371,726873,,Hi.
269,726875,729008,,"Howie, what happened to you?"
270,729010,732945,,We did overnight survival training in the wilderness.

273,737535,740153,,I was gonna freshen up for you
274,740155,744307,,but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom.
275,745743,746826,,Survival training?
276,746828,747943,,Is that like camping?
277,747945,748995,,Uh-huh.
278,748997,751731,,"Except you don't have food or water,"
279,751733,755234,,and they don't have a sunset Sabbath service
280,755236,758254,,like they do at Camp Hess-Kramer.
281,758256,760807,,Do you sleep in tents?
282,760809,761958,,No.
283,761960,764460,,I slept in a hole
284,764462,768431,,I dug in the ground with my bare hands.
285,768433,771868,,"And at some point during the night,"
286,771870,775338,,an armadillo crawled in
287,775340,777940,,and spooned me.
288,780110,781360,,Poor baby.
289,781362,782495,,But I did it.
290,782497,784414,,I survived.
291,784416,788935,,I wasn't sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit.
292,788937,792672,,I just pulled my turtleneck up over my head
293,792674,796342,,and waited for death.
294,796344,800129,,"But somehow as I sat there,"
295,800131,804500,,"wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat,"
296,804502,809288,,I found that primal part of the human spirit
297,809290,813342,,"that just wants to keep on living,"
298,813344,816078,,no matter what the cost.
299,816080,817396,,You're so brave.
300,817398,819065,,I'm proud of you.
301,819067,822752,,I ate a butterfly.
302,829326,832345,,It was so small and...
303,832347,834747,,"beautiful,"
304,834749,837467,,but I was so hungry.
305,840804,842889,,Are you crying?
306,842891,845708,,"No, I don't think it's possible."
307,845710,849212,,I'm severely dehydrated.
308,849214,852799,,My pee is like toothpaste.
309,852801,856686,,"Howie, if you're not able to do this, come home."
310,856688,859722,,It won't change how I feel about you.
311,859724,862742,,"Thanks, honey, but I can't quit."
312,862744,865828,,"If I do, I'll just be a guy"
313,865830,869832,,who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up.
314,869834,872067,,"Well, is there anything I could do to help?"
315,872069,874170,,No.
316,874172,875338,,Wait.
317,875340,879275,,Send more underwear.
318,880460,883529,,(bongos playing in living room)
319,888118,891521,,Don't let this be Sheldon playing bongos.
320,899947,902064,,(bongos playing)
321,906620,910389,,"(rhythmically) Hello, Leonard, do you like my bongos?"
322,911792,915110,,Bet you didn't know that I had bongos.
323,916330,918280,,"Sheldon, it's 3:00 o'clock in the morning."
324,918282,919448,,3:00 in the morning
325,919450,923285,,is a good time for bongos.
326,923287,924887,,I was sleeping.
327,924889,928123,,Leonard sleeps while I play bongos.
328,929292,931561,,"No, he doesn't."
329,931563,934347,,Leonard no sleep while I play bongos.
330,934349,936465,,Bongo solo.
331,940737,942104,,Stop! Stop it!
332,942106,944240,,Stop! Stop! Stop it!
333,949279,951664,,"What the hell?! - Oh, hi,"
334,951666,952815,,"Penny, guess what?"
335,952817,955001,,Sheldon got bongos.
336,955003,956619,,Why did you get bongos?
337,956621,958487,,Richard Feynman played the bongos.
338,958489,959922,,I thought I'd give that a try.
339,959924,961657,,Richard Feynman was a famous physicist.
340,961659,963325,,"Oh, Leonard, it's 3:00 o'clock in the morning."
341,963327,965211,,I don't care if Richard Feynman was a purple leprechaun
342,965213,967179,,who lived in my butt.
343,968131,971217,,Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun.
344,971219,972334,,Penny forgot
345,972336,974520,,to use the subjunctive.
346,975522,978173,,"Sheldon, go to bed."
347,978175,979692,,You have work in the morning.
348,979694,980943,,"Maybe, maybe not."
349,980945,983846,,Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world.
350,985282,988200,,"No, no, hang on, uh, uh,"
351,988202,989518,,Roommate Agreement.
352,989520,992622,,"No hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets"
353,992624,995041,,after 10:00 p.m.
354,995043,996242,,Roommate Agreement?
355,996244,997359,,Are you kidding?
356,997361,998661,,We are living in a world
357,998663,1000630,,of chaos.
358,1000632,1002648,,Roommate Agreement.
359,1003834,1005835,,Where are you going?
360,1005837,1008037,,"Wherever the music takes me, kitten."
361,1011008,1012925,,I play bongos
362,1012927,1014060,,walking down the stairs.
363,1014062,1017480,,(tumbling down stairs) Oh! Oh!
364,1019683,1023719,,(playing bongos) Never play bongos walking down the stairs.
365,1024871,1026405,,(knocking)
366,1029493,1030609,,Surprise.
367,1030611,1032445,,What are you doing here?
368,1032447,1034163,,I'm here to help you get through this.
369,1034165,1036332,,"You can't do it on your own, you need someone"
370,1036334,1037583,,to take care of you.
371,1037585,1038884,,"Oh, I love you so much."
372,1038886,1040202,,"Oh, I love you."
373,1040204,1043589,,"MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard, your bath is getting cold!"
374,1045709,1048094,,"Don't worry, once she falls asleep,"
375,1048096,1050846,,I'll spoon you like an armadillo.
376,1055052,1059138,,He showed up in the middle of the night with his bongos.
377,1059140,1063092,,I foolishly thought it was some sort of musical booty call.
378,1064111,1066128,,Poor guy.
379,1066130,1068898,,He must have been exhausted.
380,1068900,1071734,,Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo!
381,1074270,1076455,,That was kind of uncalled for.
382,1076457,1077940,,"No, it was called for."
383,1079076,1080626,,What's going on?
384,1080628,1081627,,"All right, Sheldon,"
385,1081629,1083129,,this craziness has gone on long enough.
386,1083131,1085414,,Please come home so I can cut your hair.
387,1085416,1087750,,"Penny, you're not trained."
388,1087752,1089251,,You're not licensed.
389,1089253,1093222,,"Most importantly, you don't have access to my haircut records."
390,1096059,1098044,,"All right, honey, look,"
391,1098046,1100396,,"we've known each other for a long time now, right?"
392,1100398,1102798,,"I've taken you to Disneyland,"
393,1102800,1104934,,"I kicked a bully in the nuts for you,"
394,1104936,1106936,,"I sing you ""Soft Kitty"""
395,1106938,1108938,,"when you're sick,"
396,1108940,1110523,,you've even saw me naked once.
397,1110525,1113676,,"I'm sorry, what?"
398,1113678,1115644,,It was a long story.
399,1115646,1117980,,"Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I know what I'm doing."
400,1117982,1119532,,Please let me cut your hair.
401,1119534,1122535,,"Amy, what do you think?"
402,1122537,1126321,,There's not a hair on my body I wouldn't let this woman trim.
403,1134714,1136849,,"Fine, let's go."
404,1140303,1142221,,Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch.
405,1142223,1144006,,"There's only so many times a woman can say,"
406,1144008,1145357,,"""How about the bed?"""
407,1148645,1151180,,What's this about Sheldon seeing you naked?
408,1151182,1155034,,"Oh, relax. It was just her bottom and her breasts."
409,1165251,1167152,,Almost done.
410,1167154,1168954,,"At the end of the haircut,"
411,1168956,1172324,,Mr. D'Onofrio would tell me a dirty joke.
412,1172326,1175928,,"Sorry, I don't know any dirty jokes."
413,1175930,1179281,,"That's okay, I never understood them anyway."
414,1181217,1183385,,"Okay, what do you think?"
415,1185438,1188023,,"Hm, well,"
416,1188025,1190959,,it's a little Hollywood.
417,1192061,1194296,,But I think I can pull it off.
418,1194298,1195631,,"Well done, Penny."
419,1195633,1196848,,"Ha, told you."
420,1196850,1198700,,"Okay, I'm just gonna clean up your neck a little"
421,1198702,1201787,,and then you are good to go. Fun time.
422,1201789,1202871,,(giggles)
423,1202873,1205791,,"Sorry, sometimes the clippers tickle me."
424,1205793,1207326,,Okay.
425,1207328,1209528,,(laughs)
426,1214567,1216885,,"Okay, yep, we're all done now."
427,1216887,1217869,,It's just... it's good.
428,1217871,1220422,,Let me just take that away from you.
429,1220424,1222090,,Okay. - Thank you very much.
430,1222092,1224259,,You are welcome.
431,1230089,1231159,,(door closes)
