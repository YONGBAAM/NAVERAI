285,777477,779277,,My mother didn't allow me to watch it.
286,779279,781779,,She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.
287,784099,785450,,I've got to go.
288,785452,786784,,I've got to get up early.
289,786786,788436,,My company's testing a new steroid
290,788438,790271,,"that supposedly doesn't shrink testicles,"
291,790273,793908,,and the last one there has to do e measuring.
292,793910,796077,,"I guess I should get going, too."
293,797612,800164,,"Good night, painting Penny."
294,800166,802216,,"Good night, real Penny."
295,802218,804585,,"Good night, real Amy."
296,804587,807889,,"You don't have to say good night to painting Amy,"
297,807891,809874,,'cause she's never leaving.
298,812478,814345,,"Good night, real Penny."
299,814347,816147,,Bye.
300,816149,818065,,"Good night, transvestite Penny."
301,820969,822103,,(sighs)
302,822105,824355,,Okay. Let us take you off the wall.
303,827159,829360,,"Out of sight, out of mind."
304,830812,832980,,I wish.
305,834633,837368,,"You know, can I borrow that movie?"
306,837370,839670,,Those singing hooligans really got my motor running.
307,839672,841873,,"Sure, sure. Enjoy."
308,841875,844208,,"I mean, get it back to me when you can, or..."
309,844210,845593,,"you know what, actually, you keep it."
310,845595,847011,,It's just going to be my gift to you.
311,847013,848713,,Bye. - Thank you.
312,848715,850664,,Wait... Where'd the painting go?
313,850666,852216,,It's right over there.
314,853418,855603,,Why?
315,856271,858472,,I have no idea. That is weird.
316,861176,862610,,You hate it. - No.
317,862612,865730,,"No, no. It's just, it's a little big."
318,865732,867949,,"I feel like an idiot. - No, come on, you're not an idiot."
319,867951,869300,,"Look, just help me put it back up."
320,869302,871352,,Why? So you can just take it down when I leave?
321,871354,873704,,"I don't need your pity. Oh, Amy, come on..."
322,873706,877241,,(choking up): I'm just glad I didn't go for the sculpture.
323,880078,883614,,"Ah, the spoils."
324,883616,885416,,I see why victors love them.
325,887319,888753,,"I'm happy for you, Sheldon."
326,888755,891455,,But I have to admit I'm going to miss sharing an office with you.
327,891457,892924,,"Oh, of course you are."
328,892926,895159,,Feel free to drop by any time.
329,895161,897228,,Thank you. Yeah. Call first.
330,903068,905136,,Oh. Hello.
331,907439,908406,,Professor Rothman.
332,908408,910208,,This isn't your office anymore.
333,910210,911609,,You're retired.
334,911611,917381,,"I think the word you're looking for is... ""invisible."""
335,920953,923487,,I came to say I'm sorry.
336,923489,925289,,Don't bother.
337,925291,927258,,"Oh, Amy, please. I'm so humiliated."
338,927260,929493,,"I sat there the whole time that we were watching ""Grease,"""
339,929495,931963,,thinking you liked the painting. I know.
340,931965,933998,,"I was a fool from ""Summer Lovin'"" to the very last"
341,934000,935967,,"""rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong."""
342,937836,939337,,You're right. You're absolutely right.
343,939339,940871,,I should have been honest with you
344,940873,942740,,and told you the gift was too much.
345,942742,944842,,"Yes, too much."
346,944844,946844,,Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical.
347,946846,950014,,I clearly like you more than you like me.
348,950016,951782,,I don't think you can put a number on
349,951784,953384,,how much one person likes another.
350,953386,956320,,I bought you a painting that's 12 square feet in area.
351,956322,957388,,There's a number.
352,957390,959457,,"Amy, come on..."
353,959459,961092,,"If you don't like feet, you can try dollars."
354,961094,962660,,The painting set me back three grand.
355,962662,965930,,"Three gr... Oh, my God!"
356,966732,968266,,"Look, look, Amy,"
357,968268,970968,,"all you need to know is, you are my friend"
358,970970,973371,,and I don't want to lose you out of my life.
359,973373,977008,,"I'm sorry, I'm just having trouble believing you right now."
360,979611,981078,,Grab your hammer.
361,981080,983547,,No. Damage is done.
362,983549,988419,,"Okay, look, I didn't want to say this, but the real reason"
363,988421,990855,,I took the painting down was...
364,990857,994659,,because it made Bernadette very jealous.
365,994661,996861,,"Oh, my goodness,"
366,996863,999030,,how could I have not seen that?
367,999032,1000164,,The painting is
368,1000166,1002366,,"a constant reminder that of the three of us,"
369,1002368,1004902,,she is the least cool.
370,1004904,1009073,,"Yeah, that's... that's what it is, so..."
371,1009075,1010508,,You have such a good heart.
372,1010510,1013210,,Yeah... I try.
373,1013212,1015046,,Come on.
374,1015048,1016547,,"Whoa, whoa, where are we going?"
375,1016549,1018182,,We're going to go put this painting back up
376,1018184,1019684,,"in your apartment. Well, what about Bernadette?"
377,1019686,1022420,,"Oh, screw her. She's just lucky we let her hang out with us."
378,1025357,1027525,,(air conditioner blowing loudly)
379,1045644,1046844,,What are you doing?
380,1046846,1049313,,I'm trying to raise the temperature in here
381,1049315,1051582,,before my nipples tear through my shirt.
382,1052751,1055619,,Why don't you just turn up the thermostat?
383,1055621,1057154,,Aha! Good question.
384,1057156,1059690,,It turns out the thermostat for my new office
385,1059692,1062360,,"isn't in my new office. No. It's next door,"
386,1062362,1064228,,"in Professor Davenport's office,"
387,1064230,1065963,,who is currently enjoying the hot flashes
388,1065965,1067798,,associated with menopause.
389,1068667,1070835,,Why is there a hole here?
390,1070837,1072837,,Why is there a hole in my new office?
391,1072839,1075139,,I've narrowed it down to two possibilities:
392,1075141,1076907,,"""There was something in the wall"
393,1076909,1079377,,"that someone outside the wall wanted,"""
394,1079379,1080611,,"or the more disturbing,"
395,1080613,1083881,,"""there was something in the wall that wanted out."""
396,1085283,1087685,,"Well, at least you finally got a window that opens."
397,1087687,1088619,,That's nice.
398,1088621,1090988,,Is it? Listen.
399,1090990,1092089,,(wind chimes jangle faintly)
400,1092091,1093257,,"What, you don't like wind chimes?"
401,1093259,1095493,,"No, I hate them, but it gets worse."
402,1097295,1098729,,(mockingbird whistling)
403,1098731,1101365,,There it is. - The bird?
404,1101367,1104101,,It's completely out of tune with the wind chimes.
405,1105003,1105970,,So?
406,1105972,1107204,,"You don't get it, do you?"
407,1107206,1108672,,That's a mockingbird.
408,1108674,1110741,,"Mockingbirds can change their song,"
409,1110743,1112643,,which means he's out of tune on purpose.
410,1112645,1114078,,(mockingbird continues singing)
411,1114080,1115679,,He's mocking me.
412,1115681,1116781,,(rumbling)
413,1116783,1119083,,Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?
414,1119085,1123154,,The growing realization that you are one wacky bastard? Yep.
415,1123156,1125489,,No. The vibration.
416,1125491,1127491,,"We are directly underneath the geology lab,"
417,1127493,1130094,,and they're running their confounded sieve shakers again.
418,1130096,1131395,,"Hey, gravel monkeys,"
419,1131397,1134698,,"if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!"
420,1134700,1137001,,"Sheldon, relax."
421,1137003,1138068,,How can I relax?
422,1138070,1139937,,My nervous system is being stretched out
423,1139939,1143207,,like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds
424,1143209,1145776,,and wind and the low-hanging scrotum
425,1145778,1147545,,of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.
426,1150115,1151282,,"If you're not happy,"
427,1151284,1152917,,why don't you just let Kripke have the office?
428,1152919,1154285,,"Wait, and let him win?"
429,1154287,1156287,,Do I look crazy to you?
430,1156289,1157655,,"(rumbling) We're trying to think down here,"
431,1157657,1160307,,you geode-loving feldspar jockeys!
432,1160309,1161942,,(mockingbird whistles) And you...
433,1161944,1164495,,"the notes are C, D, E, G and A."
434,1164497,1167264,,You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!
435,1177671,1179182,,How's that?
436,1179183,1181967,,Little higher on the right.
437,1181969,1183886,,Now? - Little more.
438,1183888,1185971,,No. That's got it.
439,1187891,1190476,,"Yeah, okay. That's, uh, that's good."
440,1191394,1192834,,I'll let you in on a little secret.
441,1192859,1193980,,Mm.
442,1193981,1196866,,Originally we were painted nude.
443,1202806,1205774,,"But I had him add clothes, 'cause I thought"
444,1205776,1208961,,it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality.
445,1211248,1213716,,"Yeah, good call."
446,1213718,1216001,,"But if you ever change your mind, all it would take"
447,1216003,1219054,,"is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges."
448,1220073,1221376,,"You're talking about the painting, right?"
449,1221401,1222601,,Sure.
450,1228231,1230933,,SHELDON: Help! Somebody help!
451,1234404,1235754,,What happened?
452,1235756,1239508,,I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.
453,1239510,1241643,,Why would you do that?
454,1241645,1244446,,It's called scientific curiosity!
455,1245699,1247733,,Now go get butter.
456,1247735,1249151,,Hang in there.
457,1249153,1250953,,I'll be right back.
