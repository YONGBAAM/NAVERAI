16,39315,40814,,(both chuckle)
17,40816,42182,,They called the cops because of the smell.
18,42184,44384,,They thought we were dead.
19,46888,49389,,We were badass back in the day.

40,87613,90380,,We are attending my Aunt Flora's 93rd birthday party.
41,90382,92699,,Just tell her I can't come.
42,92701,95101,,She'll be disappointed if we don't show up.
43,95103,96703,,She's 93.
44,96705,98272,,She won't be disappointed for very long.
45,100258,102993,,"No, hang on. I followed all the protocols"
46,102995,104962,,set forth by you in the relationship agreement.
47,104964,108549,,I made a written record request 72 hours in advance.
48,109450,111618,,I checked the tire pressure on the car.
49,111620,113921,,I even contacted the Centers For Disease Control to find out
50,113923,117174,,what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County.
51,118092,120844,,"FYI, it's none."
52,120846,122729,,"Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed"
53,122731,125816,,for either one of us to get our way.
54,125818,127768,,You use it to get your way.
55,127770,130187,,I use it to get the right way.
56,131322,132856,,The fact that the right way is
57,132858,135075,,also my way is a happy coincidence.
58,136628,137978,,You gave me your word.
59,137980,139196,,You're coming with me.
60,139198,140397,,"We'll miss you, Sheldon."

80,192971,194552,,Can you recommend a gift?
81,195738,198239,,"Uh, I don't know."
82,198241,200887,,Could put a tennis ball on the end of Excalibur.
83,200888,203088,,Make a pretty badass cane.
84,204559,206644,,Do you supply the the tennis balls? No.
85,206646,207995,,Then no.
86,209714,210598,,What else?
87,210600,211765,,Hmm...
88,211767,214902,,"Oh, have this collectors edition"
89,214904,216236,,Batman utility belt.
90,216238,219490,,Maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy.
91,220942,223243,,"Well, she'd just look silly wearing that"
92,223245,224728,,without the rest of the costume.
93,227699,230117,,"I'm sorry Sheldon, that's it. That's all I got."
94,230119,231234,,"Oh, it's not your fault."
95,231236,232953,,I've been to the model train store.
96,232955,234571,,I've been to Radio Shack.
97,234573,237124,,This woman is impossible to shop for.
98,237126,240010,,I'd make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems

100,243282,246249,,"No, Leonard, go ahead and mock."
101,246251,249837,,"Like my daddy always said, ""Shelly, women aren't anything"

106,261866,263200,,"Look, if you don't want to go"
107,263202,264601,,"to the party, just don't go."
108,264603,265602,,You're a grown man.
109,265604,266937,,Act like one.
110,266939,269623,,Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover
111,269625,271875,,and playing video games with your friends.
112,272877,274328,,Maybe she'll dig it.
113,274330,277214,,Women like a firm hand on the tiller.
114,277216,279066,,I can never find the tiller.
115,281920,285422,,I got a book; it didn't help.
116,285424,288175,,"Yeah, I always thought if I were ever enslaved,"
117,288177,291428,,"it would be by an advanced species from another planet,"
118,291430,295149,,not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale.
119,295151,297351,,"Now, I downloaded an app that"

123,304977,306844,,You're right.
124,306846,310214,,I'm smart as a whip. I should be able to figure this out.
125,313317,315285,,"Hey, listen, I kind of made plans"
126,315287,317588,,"with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered,"
127,317590,319673,,"because we're in this relationship-beta-test,"
128,319675,321508,,if I should have asked you first.
129,321510,324461,,"Then I thought if I did check with you first,"
130,324463,327548,,then you'd think that I was taking things too seriously.
131,327550,330000,,And then-en I got a nosebleed.
132,330002,332553,,You don't have to check with me.
133,332555,334555,,Do whatever you want.
134,334557,336223,,Oh.
135,336225,339109,,"I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay."
136,339111,341145,,"Really, what were you hoping for?"
137,341147,342529,,"I don't know,"
138,342531,344531,,"maybe that you'd be a little upset,"
139,344533,346617,,and then you'd realize that
140,346619,348869,,I'm a stallion that has to run free.
141,352791,355242,,And that would turn you on a little.
142,355244,359029,,"Okay, I'm an actress. Ask me again."
143,359031,361298,,Do you mind if I spend the weekend
144,361300,362916,,playing video games with the guys?
145,362918,364885,,Wha... the entire weekend?
146,364887,366553,,You mean I wouldn't see you at all?
147,366555,367504,,But I j...
148,367506,368371,,"No, no..."
149,368373,371058,,I knew what I was getting into.
150,371060,374378,,You can't put a saddle on Leonard Hofstadter.

154,384073,385489,,(chuckles) What is that?
155,385491,387875,,An acting choice. - Oh.
156,387877,390277,,"So you chose that when you become turned on,"
157,390279,393163,,you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?

159,397752,399286,,Uh-uh.
160,399288,403173,,(knocking) SHELDON: Penny! Penny! Penny!

165,413135,414751,,Gummy bears? Thank you.

168,420926,424478,,commitment to attend her aunt's tedious birthday party.
169,424480,425729,,Not a chance.
170,425731,426980,,All right.
171,426982,428615,,I thought the candy might not be enough
172,428617,430818,,so let me up the ante. (clears throat)
173,430820,432820,,These are Cooper Coupons.
174,432822,435906,,These are for various things I can do for you.
175,435908,437407,,"Um, oh, this one"
176,437409,439626,,is for one free grammar check.
177,439628,441161,,Uh...
178,441163,443330,,"You could use it for emails, letters,"
179,443332,444665,,"tattoos, what have you."
180,444667,446333,,Um...
181,446335,447751,,"Oh, this is fun one!"
182,447753,451138,,"This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center,"
183,451140,454141,,where I point out their mistakes.
184,454143,456960,,"Keep an eye on those expiration dates,"

188,462651,465018,,"Oh, come on. It's just a simple favor."
189,465020,466153,,"Now, when's the last time I asked you"
190,466155,467154,,to do something for me?
191,467156,469356,,Yesterday. You made me look in your ear
192,469358,471358,,to see if there was a ladybug in it.
193,471360,474311,,When is the last time I asked you to do something
194,474313,475645,,that wasn't a medical emergency?
195,475647,477364,,Yesterday. You made me look in your ear
196,477366,479566,,to see if there was a ladybug in it.
197,480818,482336,,"All right, then, I have no choice"
198,482338,483653,,but to go on to plan B.
199,483655,484821,,What's that?
200,484823,485989,,I'm going to run around outside
201,485991,487991,,with a wet head and try to catch a cold.
202,492213,493430,,Good morning.
203,493432,495098,,Hello.
204,495100,497384,,I think you're really going to enjoy yourself today.
205,497386,499052,,"Not only do you get to meet my relatives,"
206,499054,501438,,"but since you aunt's nursing home is catering the party,"
207,501440,503056,,all of the food is incredibly soft.
208,503058,505442,,It's like a vacation for your teeth.
209,505444,507010,,All right.
210,508679,510314,,You sure you're okay with this?
211,510316,511698,,Yes.
212,511700,514034,,I decided to find a way that I could

227,550522,552906,,and you don't mind me showing up at a party all by myself

244,602061,605195,,"not my swimsuit size, thank you very much."
245,605197,607480,,"Gentlemen, the game offers us a choice,"
246,607482,610334,,"between playing for the Republic and the light side,"
247,610336,613420,,or the Sith Empire and the dark side.
248,613422,614871,,"Well, we're always the good guys."
249,614873,616373,,"In D&D, we're lawful good,"
250,616375,618058,,"in City Of Heroes, we're the heroes,"
251,618060,620928,,"and Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly,"

257,639782,641782,,I think Raj beat you to it.
258,641784,645035,,No. Bernadette's going to be playing with us.

260,648490,651358,,"What, you invited your girlfriend?!"
261,651360,653360,,This is supposed to be our weekend!

270,667622,669187,,"And then I bought her a new laptop and the game,"

272,672742,674660,,Is the whip sound app

276,681002,685654,,(whip cracks) (laughter)
277,685656,687973,,(laughing): I was wrong; it's still funny.
278,687975,689391,,"Oh, good."
279,689393,691710,,(high-pitched laugh)
280,695381,696649,,Oh.
281,696651,698984,,"Amy, what's wrong?"
282,698986,700719,,My boyfriend's a jerk.
283,701688,703405,,"Well, I know he didn't cheat on you,"
284,703407,704657,,so what happened?
285,705692,708577,,"I had to go to my aunt's party all by myself,"
286,708579,710112,,"and everybody was like,"
287,710114,711613,,"""Where's this boyfriend you're always talking about?"
288,711615,714033,,"""Is he real, or did you make him up like Armen,"
289,714035,717036,,"the miniature horse breeder?"""
290,717038,719788,,Who's Armen the miniature horse breeder?
291,719790,723075,,The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back.
292,723077,725260,,It unraveled quickly when I couldn't answer the question
293,725262,727763,,"""How'd you two meet?"""
294,727765,730582,,I would have thought at a miniature horse show.
295,730584,733085,,"Oh, that's good. - Mm."
296,733087,736121,,I panicked and said Woodstock.
297,736123,737306,,(sighs)
298,737308,740192,,I just wanted to show Sheldon off to my family.
299,740194,741443,,"Sure, I get that."
300,741445,743762,,"I mean, he's your first boyfriend and all."
301,743764,745981,,"Not just my first boyfriend, he's the best boyfriend."
302,745983,747649,,"I mean, think about it."
303,747651,750085,,I'm dating Sheldon Cooper.
304,752438,753572,,Yes.
305,753574,756158,,On purpose.
306,756160,757793,,"He's handsome, he's lanky,"
307,757795,759545,,"he's brilliant,"
308,759547,763365,,"and his skin has that pale, waxy quality."
309,763367,765868,,"Well, sickly is the new sexy."
310,768538,771240,,Yeah. - Mm.
311,771242,772775,,"You know, Amy,"
312,772777,775427,,sometimes when you're in a relationship with someone
313,775429,777312,,"you really care about, the sucky part is,"
314,777314,778931,,it leaves you open to getting hurt.
315,778933,781767,,Do you ever worry about Leonard doing that to you?
316,781769,784586,,(laughs) That's hilarious. No.
317,786806,788574,,Get that guy! Get that guy!
318,788576,791309,,Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!
319,792162,793095,,"Dr. Rostenkowski,"
320,793097,794496,,it may interest you to know
321,794498,797199,,"that saying ""pew, pew, pew"" isn't as effective"
322,797201,799668,,as pressing your blaster key.
323,799670,801754,,"In the same way that saying ""whee!"""
324,801756,804206,,doesn't make the land speeder go.
325,805992,808177,,Pew!
326,809629,811263,,"Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail."
327,811265,812881,,(groaning): Got him.
328,812883,815768,,"When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence,"
329,815770,819922,,I bet he didn't know how much fun it was killing stuff.
330,819924,822507,,"All right, I think we got them all."
331,822509,824109,,Let's divide up the loot.
332,824111,826645,,"BERNADETTE: Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got."
333,826647,829114,,You should put on yours and then we'll match.
334,829116,832017,,But I worked hard to get this armor.
335,832019,833535,,"Sorry, I just thought it'd be nice"
336,833537,836705,,if people knew we were a couple.
337,836707,838690,,"Fine, I'll change."
338,839626,842394,,(whip cracks)
339,846166,847883,,(high-pitched laugh)
340,851805,853581,,I don't think I want to play a game.
341,853606,854457,,"Oh, come on!"
342,854458,855722,,They're playing one across the hall--
343,855747,856947,,"we should, too."
344,857011,859478,,"Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter"
345,859480,861847,,"off the table, and if it goes into this cup,"
346,861849,863265,,the other person has to drink.
347,863267,864850,,Then you get to go again...
348,864852,867035,,(coin clinks in glass)
349,869506,871023,,Like that?
350,871025,873192,,"Wow. Yeah, b-beginner's luck."
351,873194,877112,,"So, now I will drink this entire cup of beer, and you"
352,877114,879364,,will go again... (coin clinks in glass)
353,881484,882734,,Uh...
354,882736,884870,,"All right. So, yeah, okay, now I'm gonna"
355,884872,888173,,drink this entire cup and then I'm going to drink another one.
356,888175,891660,,"(coin clinks in glass) Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?"
357,891662,893128,,Spent a lot of my childhood
358,893130,895413,,throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends.
359,895415,897432,,"At a certain point, you start doing trick shots"
360,897434,899751,,just to keep things interesting.
361,899753,902938,,"Whoa, give me a second to catch up here. Hold on."
362,902940,904456,,(guys cheering across the hall)
363,904458,906208,,That'd be my boyfriend
364,906210,907559,,happier playing
365,907561,909278,,his dopey Star Trek game with his friends
366,909280,910395,,than hanging out with me.
367,910397,912698,,Wars. - What?
368,912700,913782,,Star Wars.
369,913784,915951,,They get all cranky when you mix the two up.
370,915953,917035,,What's the difference?
371,917037,919788,,There's absolutely no difference.
372,921875,924576,,How do I get him to treat me better?
373,924578,925744,,All right.
374,925746,927913,,Let me give you a little girlfriend 101.
375,927915,930082,,Usually the first move out of the gate
376,930084,931383,,"is you withhold sex,"
377,931385,933952,,but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty.
378,933954,937472,,"So, I'd say..."
379,937474,939424,,give him the silent treatment.
380,939426,941393,,"No, he loves that. Hmm."
381,941395,943428,,Our record for sitting in a room together
382,943430,946481,,and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours.
383,946483,949184,,He said it was a magical evening.
384,949186,951136,,"All right, then we're gonna have to go"
385,951138,952404,,with an oldie but goodie;
386,952406,953522,,making a scene.
387,953524,955824,,I don't think I'd be good at that.
388,955826,957276,,That's why you're lucky to have me.
389,957278,959194,,"Back in Omaha, there are two different restaurants"
390,959196,960762,,I'm not allowed into. Both Chili's.
391,964667,966285,,"Bernadette, remember, your character's"
392,966287,968036,,the healer in our group.
393,968038,970756,,"You're in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard."
394,970758,972507,,I can't help it.
395,972509,975327,,My Howie Wowie has an owie.
396,976262,978964,,That is the most sickeningly sweet thing
397,978966,980799,,I have ever experienced.
398,980801,986338,,And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.
399,986340,989274,,"Sheldon Cooper, I've got a bone to pick with you,"
400,989276,991977,,and I'm about to do it in front of all your friends.
401,991979,995847,,"Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!"
402,995849,997032,,"I'm gonna publicly shame you,"
403,997034,999401,,and then sit back as societal pressure compels you
404,999403,1000619,,to modify your behavior.
405,1000621,1003188,,"Ooh, buuurn!"
406,1004207,1005991,,"And if you don't start treating me better,"
407,1005993,1007042,,I'm leaving you
408,1007044,1009694,,for a miniature horse breeder named Armen.
409,1010496,1012547,,Armen who?
410,1012549,1014216,,Armen... damn it.
411,1016702,1019638,,"Look, Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family,"
412,1019640,1021423,,"and you stood her up, okay?"
413,1021425,1024209,,"Look at this adorable, smushy face."
414,1024211,1027212,,"Smush, smush, smush."
415,1027214,1028713,,You're hurting me.
416,1028715,1031650,,"No, Sheldon hurt you."
417,1031652,1033685,,Before; now it's you.
418,1033687,1035520,,Oh.
419,1035522,1038340,,I think I understand.
420,1038342,1039441,,You're the one person
421,1039443,1041994,,"who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend,"
422,1041996,1044780,,but that rings hollow if you can't lord him
423,1044782,1046698,,over others in the flesh.
424,1048167,1049251,,I forget what I bring
425,1049253,1051119,,to the party and what I take away
426,1051121,1052921,,when I leave.
427,1052923,1057759,,Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons...
428,1059429,1061847,,...as restitution.
429,1061849,1063215,,"Sheldon, she doesn't want your stupid..."
430,1063217,1065017,,"Ooh, Science Center. Redeeming."
431,1065019,1067419,,Let's go.
432,1068471,1070355,,"Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler."
433,1070357,1072224,,Let me get my coat.
434,1072226,1073792,,(whip cracks)
435,1073794,1075477,,"Oh, grow up, Leonard."
436,1075479,1077479,,"But e-excuse me,"
437,1077481,1079597,,I have something to say.
438,1080616,1083535,,"None of you may realize it, but I was very much"
439,1083537,1085320,,looking forward to this weekend.
440,1085322,1086405,,It was gonna be like
441,1086407,1088907,,the old days-- the four of us hanging out
442,1088909,1090625,,playing video games before you guys
443,1090627,1092294,,all got girlfriends.
444,1092296,1094212,,Do you have any idea what it's like
445,1094214,1096631,,to be the only one without a girlfriend?
446,1096633,1098166,,"Even if I get one someday,"
447,1098168,1100168,,I'll still be the guy who got a girl
448,1100170,1102971,,after Sheldon Cooper!
449,1107226,1110462,,And that's how a girl makes a scene.
450,1115184,1116184,,"I'm sorry, sweetie."
451,1116186,1117819,,You're right. You deserve your weekend.
452,1117821,1119020,,"Come on, Amy, let's go."
453,1119022,1120822,,What about the Science Center?
454,1120824,1123992,,I'll let you hold my hair while I throw up.
455,1124694,1126912,,Rain check.
456,1127947,1129197,,"I'm gonna go, too."
457,1129199,1130949,,I'll miss you. - I'll miss
458,1130951,1132868,,"I'll miss you more. - No, I'll..."
459,1132870,1135253,,Just leave!
460,1138157,1140158,,"(sighs) Okay, now."
461,1140160,1142043,,This is the way it's supposed to be.
462,1142045,1144379,,"Men together, fighting the forces of evil."
463,1144381,1146515,,"LEONARD, SHELDON, WOLOWITZ: Hear! Hear!"
464,1146517,1148600,,(sighs)
465,1148602,1151503,,I can't believe this is only 64 calories.
466,1167372,1169047,,(pounding at door)
467,1169051,1170744,,MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard Joel Wolowitz!
468,1170745,1172778,,"I've been worried sick for two days,"
469,1172780,1175314,,and I know you turned off your phone!
470,1177684,1179668,,MRS. WOLOWITZ: You open up this door right now
471,1179670,1181370,,because I've had it up to here!
472,1181372,1183288,,"I have been to the morgue and the hospital,"
473,1183290,1184723,,and I spent the last half hour
474,1184725,1188393,,walking up these   stairs!
475,1191414,1193649,,That's my ride; got to go.
