167,430615,433032,,but he chose instead to expand his mind
168,433034,434200,,and learn something new.
169,434202,436619,,He went to work in his friend's biology lab.
170,436621,439539,,"Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist,"

278,701781,704281,,"Hey, Howard, I need to tell you something."
279,704283,706116,,"I know, it's not on my wedding diet."
280,706118,708035,,I don't care.
281,709454,711822,,"Uh, l-listen, I..."
282,711824,715042,,heard that Bernadette's thinking about asking you for a prenup.
283,716327,718412,,A prenup?
284,718414,720414,,(laughs) Wow.
285,720416,722316,,What are you gonna do?
286,722318,725936,,I... don't know.
287,725938,728188,,Follow your heart.
288,734012,737314,,"You know what, it's... not a big deal."
289,737316,739733,,She makes more money than me.
290,739735,743270,,She wants to protect her financial interests.
291,743272,745322,,It's completely reasonable.
292,745324,746657,,Good. That's a healthy attitude.
293,746659,748642,,"Yeah, actually, it's good for both of us."
294,748644,750160,,"I have assets to protect, too."
295,750162,752312,,Like what?
296,752314,754397,,I've got some rare comic books.
297,754399,757084,,The Vespa's almost paid off.
298,758269,761038,,And Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai
299,761040,763941,,right near the guy who played Mr. Roper on
300,763943,767094,,Mr. Roper's dead?!
301,768880,771849,,You can't just spring that on a guy!
302,773051,775018,,Here you go.
303,775020,776854,,This is now the only lab
304,776856,779556,,with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates
305,779558,783110,,and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan.
306,783978,785779,,Soap spots. Wash 'em again.
307,785781,787815,,Y... You're being ridiculous!
308,787817,789783,,Those are perfectly clean.
309,789785,792769,,"Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid"
310,792771,795038,,from an elephant that died of syphilis.
311,795040,796657,,"If it's, in fact, perfectly clean,"
312,796659,797991,,drink from it.
313,804666,807134,,Biologists are mean.
314,808469,810254,,"All right, perhaps this task"
315,810256,812389,,will be a little bit more up your alley.
316,812391,814411,,I need you to count the bacteria spores
317,814436,815459,,on these petri dishes.
318,815460,817644,,There was something wrong with that detergent.
319,817646,819980,,That was way too bubbly.
320,819982,821598,,I'm sure it was. I intend to write
321,821600,824434,,that soap company a strongly worded letter.
322,824436,826987,,"Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting."
323,827972,829940,,You know what this place needs?
324,829942,832309,,A suggestion box.
325,833444,836079,,366...
326,836081,838065,,367...
327,838067,839433,,How's it going?
328,839435,841001,,How's   going?
329,841003,842536,,"When I was in kindergarten,"
330,842538,845205,,I recited pi to a thousand places
331,845207,847207,,for the school talent show.
332,847209,849293,,I think I got this.
333,849295,850377,,Great.
334,855266,857134,,"Aw, nuts!"
335,860004,862356,,One...
336,862358,865292,,This is preposterous!
337,865294,866894,,I think you're giving me these tasks
338,866896,868462,,because you're afraid if you give me
339,868464,870814,,"anything meaningful to do, I'll show you up."
340,870816,873734,,Really? Is that what you think?
341,873736,875235,,"Yes, that's what I think."
342,875237,879022,,"And I'm super smart, so it's probably true."
343,879024,880741,,"Hey, I've been training in the field"
344,880743,882159,,of neurobiology for 12 years.
345,882161,883710,,"You've been here for three hours,"
346,883712,886196,,and you've spent one of them in the bathroom.
347,886198,888382,,I'm sorry! It takes me a while
348,888384,891335,,to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.
349,891337,893837,,"Sheldon, I've given you the simplest things to do,"
350,893839,896056,,and you haven't done one of them right.
351,896058,897891,,Maybe that's because I'm not being challenged.
352,897893,900543,,It's the same reason Einstein failed math.
353,900545,902729,,Maybe the math was too bubbly for him.
354,902731,905349,,You think you're doing science by cutting up that brain?
355,905351,907768,,They could do the same thing at any Quiznos.
356,907770,911571,,"they'd offer to toast it for me, too."
357,911573,912856,,"Okay, smart guy."
358,912858,915192,,"I'm about to remove the locus coeruleus,"
359,915194,917778,,which is incredibly delicate work.
360,917780,919413,,Have at it.
361,920915,922416,,All right.
362,923401,926569,,I'm no stranger to a little gray matter.
363,929340,931842,,Locus coeruleus.
364,934412,937180,,Locus coeruleus.
365,937182,940467,,"You're getting warmer-- it is, indeed, in the brain."
366,942220,943420,,Hope your hands are steady.
367,943422,945355,,It's the width of a single hair.
368,945357,947819,,"But this is just biology, so I'm sure it's no problem"
369,947844,948860,,for a genius like you.
370,948861,951528,,"It's not. I'll have you know, in the field of physics,"
371,951530,953196,,"we work with particles so small,"
372,953198,956083,,they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus.
373,957601,960287,,"I.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house,"
374,960289,962939,,it sits   the house.
375,967045,969629,,"Oh... are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?"
376,969631,971164,,No.
377,971166,972782,,What you see
378,972784,976169,,is a man trembling with confidence.
379,980258,982893,,Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?
380,982895,985529,,No. But your thumb does.
381,988016,990017,,"Oh, dear."
382,993121,996823,,"Yeah,   a biologist."
383,1000144,1002329,,What are you doing here?
384,1002331,1004281,,I'm on vacation.
385,1004283,1006083,,Social convention dictates
386,1006085,1009453,,that I let my hair down at a local watering hole.
387,1012006,1014541,,Social convention is stupid.
388,1015493,1017961,,What happened to your thumb?
389,1017963,1019829,,"You know, I have ten fingers and ten toes."
390,1019831,1022182,,"If I tell you a story about each one of them,"
391,1022184,1024468,,we'll be here all day-- let's just move on.
392,1024470,1026269,,What can I get you?
393,1026271,1028972,,"Ah, seeing as I'm on vacation,"
394,1028974,1031391,,"uh, pina colada seems appropriate."
395,1031393,1034177,,"Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream,"
396,1034179,1036363,,"extra cherries, extra umbrellas,"
397,1036365,1038665,,"and, uh, hold the rum."
398,1039867,1043203,,Don't let me have too many of those.
399,1043205,1044871,,"Hey, what are you guys doing here?"
400,1044873,1048024,,We're grown men; we drink at bars.
401,1048026,1050660,,No and no.
402,1052380,1054498,,Everything okay with you and Bernadette?
403,1054500,1056550,,"(chuckles): Oh, yeah, sure."
404,1056552,1058218,,You and Amy? Good?
405,1058220,1060420,,"Oh, better than good."
406,1061406,1062939,,You know those girls text me
407,1062941,1065208,,every detail of their lives as it happens.
408,1065210,1067644,,I'm not signing a prenup.
409,1067646,1069429,,"All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up."
410,1069431,1071932,,"You sign anything she puts in front of you,"
411,1071934,1073767,,because you are the luckiest man alive.
412,1073769,1075235,,"If you let her go, there is no way"
413,1075237,1077404,,"you can find anyone else-- speaking on behalf of all women,"
414,1077406,1079439,,it is not gonna happen; we had a meeting.
415,1081742,1083110,,"And you, a grown man"
416,1083112,1085890,,fainting at the sight of a little blood.
417,1085915,1086730,,"Excuse me,"
418,1086731,1089616,,this is a fairly substantial wound.
419,1089618,1091168,,You...
420,1091170,1093286,,(heavy thud)
421,1095773,1098408,,(light tapping) SHELDON: Amy? Amy?
422,1098410,1100410,,Amy?
423,1101629,1103463,,What do you want?
424,1103465,1107551,,I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing
425,1107553,1109186,,in your laboratory.
426,1109188,1112389,,"After all, I did book the whole week."
427,1113524,1116593,,Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here
428,1116595,1118278,,after the way you behaved yesterday?
429,1118280,1120814,,I was not myself.
430,1120816,1124484,,I had lost a lot of thumb blood.
431,1125536,1127287,,That's not an apology.
432,1127289,1129723,,That is your opinion.
433,1129725,1132125,,I want a real apology.
434,1133494,1136746,,I'm sorry that you weren't able to...
435,1136748,1138331,,No.
436,1138333,1140333,,...that my genius...
437,1140335,1141585,,No.
438,1141587,1143170,,...that the soap was...
439,1143172,1144888,,Sheldon.
440,1147341,1148842,,Fine.
441,1151479,1153930,,Sorry.
442,1153932,1155798,,You're forgiven.
443,1155800,1159269,,"Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers."
444,1159271,1161771,,They're still dirty from yesterday.
445,1165276,1167494,,Next year I'm going to Epcot.
446,1177889,1179923,,Are you mad at me?
447,1179925,1181925,,No. I'm not mad at you.
448,1181927,1183060,,I just...
449,1183062,1184678,,"wish you would have come to me,"
450,1184680,1188865,,so I didn't have to hear it through the nerd-vine.
451,1190217,1191944,,"So, what are we gonna do?"
452,1191969,1193169,,(sighs)
453,1193188,1195555,,You really want me to sign a prenup?
454,1195557,1196690,,I don't know.
455,1196692,1199242,,"My dad's pretty insistent on it, though."
456,1199244,1202496,,"Why don't I talk to your dad, man-to-man?"
457,1202498,1205064,,"Really? Oh, that'd be so great!"
458,1205066,1206700,,Done.
459,1206702,1210454,,I should probably give you a heads-up about a couple of things.
460,1211839,1213790,,"Even though he's retired from the police force,"
461,1213792,1215425,,he still carries his gun.
462,1216828,1218378,,"But don't worry, he won't shoot it."
463,1218380,1220597,,It's more of a fashion statement.
464,1221849,1223216,,Okay.
465,1223218,1226085,,"And just to be safe, when you talk to him,"
466,1226087,1228472,,"don't bring up Jimmy Carter, gardeners,"
467,1228474,1230390,,"foreign people, homosexuals,"
468,1230392,1232793,,"Sean Penn, Vatican II, gun control, organic food,"
469,1232795,1234762,,"the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact"
470,1234787,1236087,,that you're Jewish.
471,1239266,1241568,,"Got it, got it."
472,1241570,1244955,,Will you e-mail me that list?
473,1244957,1247207,,"So the thing to watch for,"
474,1247209,1248992,,"if he's shouting at you, you're okay,"
475,1248994,1250961,,"but if he starts to get real quiet,"
476,1250963,1253997,,leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact.
477,1255616,1259669,,Not in a straight line-- throw some zigs and zigs in there.
478,1261506,1263507,,"You know, this isn't that pressing."
479,1263509,1266092,,Why don't I talk to him about it in May.
480,1266094,1269179,,In May you're gonna be on the International Space Station.
481,1270230,1271696,,They got a phone.
