283,735420,737120,,"""I can't believe I waited this long"
284,737122,739222,,"to make my own potpourri"""""
285,740625,742226,,"Sheldon, why don't you just acknowledge"
286,742228,743494,,that you have feelings for Amy
287,743496,745763,,and you don't want her going out with other men?
288,745765,749533,,And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.
289,749535,750634,,Here's a radical thought.
290,750636,753003,,"Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight."
291,753005,754638,,"I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter"
292,754640,756540,,than two skinny white guys
293,756542,758942,,swatting at each other with their eyes closed.
294,761345,763546,,And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.
295,764448,765414,,That's all of us.
296,765416,767316,,Can I use the laptop? - Why?
297,767318,771220,,I have to buy that stupid collector's tin.
298,772322,774323,,Who do we love? Penny.
299,774325,775825,,Who do we love? Penny.
300,775827,778394,,Who do we love? Penny.
301,778396,780129,,"Hello, Sheldon."
302,780131,781364,,Come on in.
303,781366,782732,,Thank you.
304,782734,784534,,What's up?
305,784536,788337,,I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.
306,790173,792241,,"I'm sorry, what?"
307,792243,793509,,A date.
308,793511,794677,,You and me.
309,794679,796279,,"Dining, dancing,"
310,796281,799316,,perhaps you'd like to take in a prizefight.
311,800386,803254,,"God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?"
312,803256,804455,,No.
313,804457,807458,,Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart?
314,807460,809793,,Whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes
315,809795,811762,,or intercourse tonight.
316,811764,814397,,"Okay, listen to me."
317,814399,817468,,Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.
318,817470,819603,,I am not trying to get her back.
319,819605,822906,,"But, out of curiosity, what is a way?"
320,822908,824975,,"All right, honey, let me tell you a story."
321,824977,828145,,"There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt."
322,828147,830313,,"Eventually, he started going out with someone else,"
323,830315,832249,,and I always regretted it.
324,832251,834485,,Do you see where I'm going with this?
325,834487,836120,,I believe I do.
326,836122,837355,,Mm.
327,837357,839491,,I'm the guy.
328,842695,844195,,You're not the guy.
329,844197,846131,,Are you sure?
330,846133,847932,,That would explain so much.
331,847934,850535,,"Your constant presence in my apartment,"
332,850537,853338,,"that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me,"
333,853340,854573,,the way you call me
334,854575,856641,,"""sweetie"" all the time."
335,856643,857976,,"I call everyone ""sweetie."""
336,857978,858876,,You tramp.
337,862180,863547,,"Look, Sheldon, all I'm saying is"
338,863549,865649,,strap on a pair and go talk to Amy.
339,865651,867685,,"""Strap on a pair""?"
340,867687,870522,,"Of what, skates?"
341,872158,875026,,"Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy."
342,881835,883703,,"If you're bored, you can go."
343,883705,886339,,I understand.
344,886341,889009,,"No, I'm having a nice time."
345,889978,892312,,Don't patronize me.
346,894181,895548,,Excuse me. Excuse me.
347,895550,896716,,Pardon me.
348,897652,899218,,Pardon me. Excuse me.
349,899220,900253,,"Hi, Stuart."
350,900255,901053,,"Hi, Sheldon."
351,901055,903089,,Pardon me... Excuse me...
352,907994,910062,,"Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
353,910064,912866,,The thought of you sitting in a darkened theater
354,912868,916236,,with a character like Stuart is repellent.
355,917672,919507,,"No offense, Stuart."
356,919509,920942,,None taken.
357,920944,924279,,"Although ""repellent"" is kind of a... kind of a strong word."
358,928118,930920,,"I'm sorry this causes you discomfort,"
359,930922,933322,,but based on the currently established parameters
360,933324,935325,,"of our relationship, I can put myself"
361,935327,937127,,in any repellent situation I want.
362,937129,938962,,"Um, again..."
363,938964,941298,,"Stuart, please. You're being rude."
364,943435,945870,,Anything else?
365,945872,949506,,I believe I would like to alter
366,949508,952276,,the paradigm of our relationship.
367,954112,955979,,I'm listening.
368,955981,960817,,"With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever,"
369,960819,962686,,"physical or otherwise,"
370,962688,965189,,I would not object to us
371,965191,970527,,"no longer characterizing you as ""not my girlfriend."""
372,976134,978501,,Interesting.
373,978503,981671,,Now try it without the quadruple negative.
374,981673,985041,,You're being impossible.
375,985043,987243,,"Hi, Stuart."
376,989146,992148,,Fine.
377,992150,995719,,Amy...
378,995721,998856,,will you be my girlfriend?
379,1005231,1006231,,Yes.
380,1006233,1009601,,"Well, that's enough of that."
381,1009603,1011103,,Sorry to interrupt.
382,1011105,1013005,,You two enjoy your date.
383,1013007,1014739,,Here's a dollar for your troubles.
384,1014741,1016774,,Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids.
385,1016776,1018643,,Excuse me... Excuse me... Pardon me...
386,1018645,1021412,,Excuse me. Pardon me.
387,1022547,1026450,,"So, other than you taking your relationship"
388,1026452,1030687,,"to the next level with another guy, this was nice."
389,1032457,1034725,,"Yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door."
390,1034727,1036093,,"Oh, you're welcome."
391,1036095,1039930,,Amy. Amy. Amy.
392,1041799,1045236,,Let's wrap things up out there.
393,1048306,1050241,,"Um, good night, Stuart."
394,1050243,1051241,,Good night.
395,1053044,1054712,,"Take the hint, Stuart."
396,1054714,1056980,,"The lady said ""Good night."""
397,1060385,1062519,,How did you get into my apartment?
398,1062521,1065155,,Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can expect
399,1065157,1066856,,now that you're my girlfriend?
400,1068459,1070861,,Good thing I drew this up.
401,1070863,1072395,,What's that?
