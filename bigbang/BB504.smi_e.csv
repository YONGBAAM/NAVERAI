115,330422,331638,,Does she really mean that
116,331640,333356,,or was she signing it sarcastically?

133,389281,391147,,"Oh, no, I bet you didn't."""
134,393284,397420,,Maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.
135,397422,399422,,"Oh, she's here."
136,399957,402625,,No joke.
137,406881,408481,,She says she's sorry she's late.
138,408483,409933,,Tell her it doesn't matter.
139,409935,413019,,"Tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies"
140,413021,417273,,in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens.
141,418392,419943,,Really?
142,419945,421895,,That's the first thing you want to say?
143,421897,423646,,I worked on it all night. Use it.
144,423648,425732,,"Look, I don't know the sign for opalescent."
145,425734,426866,,Then spell it.
146,426868,428234,,I don't know how to spell it.
147,428236,430019,,You're blowing this for me!
148,432022,433740,,He likes your eyes.
149,433742,436192,,You're making me sound like a caveman.
150,437361,439412,,"She says, ""Thank you. You have nice eyes, too."""
151,439414,442081,,"Really? Ask her how many children she wants,"
152,442083,445385,,"and whatever number she says, say, ""Me, too."""
153,448205,449722,,No.
154,449724,452725,,"Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice"
155,452727,454677,,like James Earl Jones.
156,454679,458515,,She doesn't know what James Earl Jones sounds like.
157,458517,461818,,Great. Then she won't know I'm lying.
158,463938,466990,,"Let's see, what else can I tell you about me"
159,466992,471327,,that would make you like me?
160,471329,472779,,"Ooh, I love music."
161,474114,475748,,Do you love music?
162,475750,480036,,You really want to ask her that?
163,480038,482839,,You're right. Everyone loves music.
164,484842,487427,,"She says, ""Do you play an instrument?"""
165,487429,489078,,"No,"
166,489080,490430,,"but when I was six years old,"
167,490432,492465,,I tried to start a boy band called
168,492467,495218,,Frankie Goes to Bollywood.
169,497888,500590,,"But I couldn't get any other boys to join,"
170,500592,502559,,so my parents asked the servants
171,502561,505028,,to be my backup dancers.
172,505030,506429,,"Wait, when you sign ""servants,"""
173,506431,507614,,don't sign it like I'm bragging.
174,507616,509482,,Sign it in a way that I sound humble

176,515405,517457,,Do you hear yourself
177,517459,521210,,"Yes, but she doesn't. So get signing, hand monkey."
178,524965,529618,,I think I wrote a letter to Santa Claus every day.
179,529620,531137,,"And then on Christmas morning,"
180,531139,534056,,under the tree is a little puppy

185,541464,542648,,"Dude, what is she saying?"
186,542650,544517,,It's a funny story about a puppy.
187,544519,546135,,Just smile and laugh.
188,546137,547820,,(chuckles)
189,548738,550739,,"Quick, quick, stop smiling. - What? Why?"
190,550741,552942,,The puppy died-- it choked on a doll head.
191,552944,554527,,"Sad face, sad face!"
192,557614,559865,,"It's a little hard to see with the city lights,"
193,559867,563485,,but that W-shaped constellation is Cassiopeia.
194,563487,566655,,And she was the mother of Andromeda who's over there.

199,580304,581937,,"Oh, boy,"
200,581939,582888,,help me out here.
201,582890,584673,,Does she want me to kiss her or not?
202,584675,587342,,"I speak sign language, I don't read minds."
203,587344,588561,,"If you were me, would you kiss her?"
204,588563,591013,,"Yeah, but I'm a make out king."
205,600657,604193,,I was so smooth on that date.
206,604195,606712,,You? I made you smooth.
207,606714,608080,,You were an idiot.
208,608082,609548,,"Whatever, dude. She kissed me."
209,609550,611133,,"It might've been on your lips,"
210,611135,612418,,but it was my kiss.
211,612420,614887,,"Oh, fine. Let's agree she kissed both of us."
212,616590,618207,,Okay.
213,623771,626522,,"Mustache is looking good there, Sheldon."
214,629581,631132,,Don't thank me. Thank the dice.
215,631134,634585,,They told me what percentage of my face to shave.
216,634587,636387,,Why are you still doing this?
217,636389,637838,,Because it's working.

219,639475,641342,,"unburdened by trivial decisions,"
220,641344,643177,,I've co-authored two papers

225,650686,653053,,"You left out, got chafed testicles"

227,658393,661562,,The dice giveth and the dice taketh away.
228,663231,665166,,Is Raj out with Emily again?
229,665168,667168,,"Yeah, every night for the last month."
230,667170,669253,,"Wow, can't believe he has a girlfriend."
231,671089,672623,,Me neither.
232,674042,676910,,Here's some other fun news on the Raj/Emily front.
233,676912,680347,,He gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.
234,680349,681765,,You're kidding.
235,681767,683717,,You think she's taking advantage of him?
236,683719,684935,,"Oh, of course not."
237,684937,686637,,She wouldn't do something like that.
238,686639,688355,,She's deaf.
239,690225,693310,,Deaf women can't be gold diggers?
240,693312,695396,,"Handicapped people are nice, Leonard."
241,695398,697698,,Everyone knows that.
242,698567,701735,,"Yeah, I actually have information about Raj"
243,701737,703821,,that would be helpful with this discussion.
244,707492,710544,,Could you tell us?
245,710546,712746,,Let's see.
246,714633,716800,,"Snake eyes. Sorry, bud."
247,718003,719336,,"Wait, hang on."
248,719338,720721,,Doubles. Roll again.
249,723675,725342,,"Okay, get this."
250,727262,729563,,"It doesn't matter if he's showering her with gifts,"
251,729565,732799,,because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy.
252,733652,735019,,"What do you mean ""vastly wealthy""?"
253,735021,737321,,"Well, ""wealthy"" means a lot of money."
254,737323,738522,,"""Vastly"" means even more."
255,738524,740858,,I'm not sure what's tripping you up.
256,742110,744028,,"Look, I know they have money. I don't think it's that much."
257,744030,745312,,"No, you're wrong."
258,745314,747981,,"As you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of"
259,747983,750618,,my lesser dreams and became a notary public.
260,750620,752086,,"Well, from time to time,"
261,752088,755623,,I notarize banking documents for Raj.
262,755625,760327,,"The Koothrappalis aren't just rich, they're Richie Rich rich."
263,761546,763464,,"Well, so how much is that?"
264,763466,767218,,About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.
265,768103,769069,,What the hell?
266,769071,770688,,"The last time we went to the zoo,"
267,770690,773357,,that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro.
268,773359,775893,,"Listen, guys, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude,"
269,775895,779480,,"but I need to go call Raj's sister, who I love so much."
270,780982,783867,,So vastly much.
271,785704,790708,,"Okay, so he's got money, and it's a few gifts and a car."
272,790710,792793,,And she got him to pay off all her credit cards.
273,792795,795696,,What? He paid off her credit cards?
274,795698,798632,,"Damn it, I could've dated Raj for a couple months."
275,800218,802469,,"But I-I wouldn't have, because I'm not that kind of girl."
276,802471,804305,,We should really talk to Raj.
277,804307,807141,,"He's not going to listen, he's in love."
278,807143,808842,,Can't figure out what to do?
279,808844,811061,,I remember those days.
280,811063,814398,,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to..."
281,814400,816483,,stay right here.
282,819604,821238,,"Yeah, this is a bad idea."
283,821240,822439,,We should go. - No.
284,822441,824074,,I'm the one that introduced him to her.
285,824076,825609,,I've got to say something.
286,828446,830080,,Wow.
287,831833,833900,,You're engaged to my friend.
288,833902,836236,,"Hey, Bernadette doesn't mind where I get my motor running,"
289,836238,839406,,as long as I park in the right garage.
290,841543,844244,,I can't believe you're engaged to my friend.
291,846047,847831,,"(whispers): Oh, here she comes."
292,847833,850234,,Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick can't hear you.
293,854973,856006,,Hi.
294,856008,857691,,"Oh, hey, hi."
295,857693,858776,,Nice to see you.
296,858778,862112,,"Um, can we talk to you about Raj?"
297,863248,864782,,"She says, ""Sure, what about him"""""
298,864784,867368,,"Okay, um, gosh, how do I start?"
299,867370,871104,,"Um, see, Raj is kind of naive."
300,871106,873540,,"I mean, he hasn't dated a whole lot of women."
301,873542,877411,,"And I'm concerned that, without meaning to,"
302,877413,878962,,you might be taking advantage of him.
303,878964,881615,,"You know, by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things."
304,881617,882716,,And I-I...
305,882718,884468,,"Howard, focus."
306,884470,885836,,Tell her what I'm saying.
307,885838,886837,,Right.
308,886839,888639,,Are you a gold digger or not?
309,890709,892509,,"Oh, uh, something, something,"
310,892511,894411,,who the something do you think you are?
311,894413,895979,,Mind your own something business
312,895981,898682,,and go something yourself.
313,899300,900351,,(chuckles): Oh.
314,900353,902736,,"Wait, I got this now."
315,905490,906973,,I'm so mad at you!
316,906975,908108,,"Okay, wait..."
317,908110,910077,,How dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!
318,910079,911745,,We didn't mean for it to be an ambush.
319,911747,915582,,"Just, it's kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people."
320,915584,919253,,"And hey, since when are you so chatty?"
321,919255,920487,,I'm hammered.
322,920489,921955,,"Raj, come here."
323,921957,924875,,This girl is trouble.
324,924877,926593,,"I mean, what kind of relationship is it"
325,926595,929129,,where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?
326,929131,931932,,The best one I ever had!
327,932767,934268,,"Okay, come on."
328,934270,935803,,You know you can do better.
329,935805,938338,,Aha.
330,938340,939973,,I see what's going on here.
331,939975,943060,,"You and I had our crazy night together,"
332,943062,945813,,and now you can't stand to see me with another woman.
333,945815,947698,,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - It's okay."
334,947700,949433,,I can't get mad at your feelings.
335,949435,950701,,I don't have feelings.
336,950703,951685,,"Yeah, that's good."
337,951687,953787,,Keep telling yourself that.
338,954706,957624,,He is cuter now that I know he's rich.
339,961413,964197,,I have a surprise for you.
340,964199,965466,,Cover your eyes.
341,967385,969753,,Open them.
342,979097,981348,,It's a real ruby.
343,981350,984151,,"It was a little expensive,"
344,984153,988021,,but no one can put a price on love.
345,988023,991492,,"Although, the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it."
346,993361,995529,,(Skype ringtone playing)
347,998116,999416,,"Oh, Mummy, Daddy."
348,999418,1000784,,What a nice surprise.
349,1000786,1004471,,"No, it's not a nice surprise, it's a bad surprise."
350,1005640,1006573,,Penny called us.
351,1006575,1007674,,Penny?
352,1007676,1009059,,She told us you're spending all our money
353,1009061,1010227,,on your new girlfriend.
354,1010995,1013597,,I just got her a couple of things.
355,1013599,1015782,,"She gives me things, too."
356,1015784,1016967,,"Yeah, yeah, I'm a gynecologist."
357,1016969,1019670,,I know exactly what she gives you.
358,1020772,1024107,,You need to find a nice Indian girl from a good family.
359,1024109,1026426,,"If you keep seeing this woman, you're cut off."
360,1026428,1029413,,What? You're going to make me choose between the woman I love
361,1029415,1033484,,and the money I... have very strong feelings for?
362,1033486,1035452,,It's up to you.
363,1036855,1039389,,"Well, I choose love."
364,1039391,1041074,,(scoffs) You're an idiot.
365,1043211,1045412,,Love doesn't last.
366,1051452,1055055,,"Well, he's going to find out eventually."
367,1055057,1056557,,Think about it.
368,1061896,1066483,,My parents are making me choose between money and you.
369,1066485,1068852,,I choose you.
370,1071138,1074107,,"No, I think we'll have to return the car."
371,1075243,1077494,,"And that necklace, yeah, that, too."
372,1077496,1079663,,"But none of those things matter,"
373,1079665,1082366,,because we have something better.
374,1082368,1084484,,We have love.
375,1093928,1097698,,"Oh, Penny, I hurt so bad."
376,1097700,1099299,,"I know, I know."
377,1099301,1101301,,Sometimes I put the TV on mute
378,1101303,1103520,,just to pretend she's still with me.
379,1109644,1113363,,But I can't watch the closed captioning without crying.
380,1115199,1117851,,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
381,1117853,1119853,,I wish I could make you feel better.
382,1119855,1121572,,Seriously?
383,1121574,1123707,,I'm heartbroken and you're hitting on me?
384,1123709,1125409,,What?! No!
385,1125411,1127911,,"Look, Penny, you're great,"
386,1127913,1130130,,"but I had a long talk with my parents,"
387,1130132,1133917,,"and they said if I date an Indian girl, I get a Maserati."
388,1140219,1140985,,Mmm.
389,1140986,1142186,,"Oh, cheesecake,"
390,1142188,1143720,,"you're just as good as a woman,"
391,1143722,1145656,,even though I can't have sex with you.
392,1147458,1149660,,Try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds.
393,1154833,1157868,,Should I use the rest room or wait until we get home?
394,1157870,1160587,,"Come on, papa needs to void his bladder."
395,1160589,1163674,,"Oh, that's not what you want to see after three buttermilks."
396,1165093,1166260,,"Here you go, boys."
397,1166262,1168078,,I'll pick it up when you're ready.
398,1168080,1169429,,"Thanks for dinner, buddy."
399,1169431,1171215,,"Yeah, real big of you."
400,1171217,1173200,,"Hurry, hurry, hurry."
401,1174144,1175293,,"Oh, and don't cheap out on the tip."
402,1175295,1176711,,We all know you're loaded now.
403,1176713,1236713,,"== sync, corrected by   =="
