227,667281,669798,,and building my Lego Death Star.
228,671051,674420,,"And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette,"
229,674422,676722,,"went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy,"

238,698646,701313,,Why do I have to talk to Penny?
239,701315,702665,,She's not my girlfriend.

244,713544,714927,,"He was up late last night,"
245,714929,718130,,so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed.
246,718132,719632,,That's so sweet.
247,719634,722885,,"Yeah, but now he's gonna be up at dawn and want to play."
248,722887,725471,,"So, listen, guys,"
249,725473,728057,,the reason he was up late is because he was
250,728059,729358,,taking care of Amy.
251,729360,730893,,She's kind of upset.
252,730895,731944,,Why?
253,731946,733612,,Her feelings got hurt because you guys
254,733614,735030,,went dress shopping without her.
255,735032,737032,,I told you that would happen.
256,737034,739318,,"Okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid"
257,739320,741687,,and she's just getting a little crazy with it.
258,741689,744241,,She keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid
259,744253,746479,,"traditions in other cultures, and they're all about"
260,746480,749198,,getting naked and washing each other.
261,755669,757419,,"Yeah, and she keeps trying"
262,757421,759672,,to figure out if our cycles have synced up
263,759674,763258,,"so we can call ourselves ""The Three Menstra-Teers"""""
264,764811,768230,,We thought it would be easier to look at dresses one time without her.
265,768232,769848,,I feel terrible.
266,769873,771017,,"I know. Me, too. We'll talk to her."
267,771018,772267,,"Hey, wait,"
268,772269,773569,,how did she find out?
269,774487,776939,,Raj did it.
270,779359,782861,,And he says he would do it again.
271,784364,785914,,"Hey, I'm sorry."
272,785916,788734,,You sent me the picture; I wasn't thinking.
273,788736,790619,,"Oh, Howie. - Well, hey, I'm usually"

277,798311,800512,,"What do you tell him? - Oh,"
278,800514,801747,,"you know, just pillow talk."
279,801749,804299,,You guys have nothing to worry about.
280,804301,806101,,"Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?"
281,806103,809371,,No. All your little secrets are fine.
282,813693,816195,,"Yes, absolutely fine."
283,818148,820766,,(giggles): I'll tell you later.
284,823936,827122,,"Come on, tumor."
285,827124,831543,,"Come on, tumor, Mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma."
286,832796,835464,,"Yay, brain tumor!"
287,835466,839951,,Probably not the same reaction you had when   got the news.
288,841087,843589,,Hi. - Hello.
289,843591,845174,,What are you doing here?
290,845176,847176,,"Well, look, we just wanted to apologize"
291,847178,849511,,for not bringing you with us the other day.
292,849513,852097,,That's not necessary-- it's like   says:
293,852099,854483,,"""One of these things is not like the other,"
294,854485,857986,,"one of these things should die alone."""
295,857988,860355,,"Come on, Amy, let us make it up to you."
296,860357,861607,,We'll have a girl's night;
297,861609,863192,,we'll do whatever you want.
298,863194,864810,,We can go down to the Korean baths
299,864812,866495,,and do that thing you were talking about
300,866497,868664,,where we wash each other.
301,869616,872484,,"With-with loofah mitts, no hands."
302,873703,875571,,It's okay. I'm glad this happened.
303,875573,878290,,I can stop pretending that some beautiful girl
304,878292,880008,,and her cute-in- the-right-light friend
305,880010,882261,,want to hang out with me.
306,882263,884329,,"Amy, we're really sorry."
307,884331,885997,,"Yeah, we feel awful."
308,885999,888183,,Don't. I'll be okay. You're not the first girls
309,888185,890886,,I thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me.
310,890888,893105,,"It's like elementary school, junior high,"
311,893107,895107,,"high school, undergrad, grad school,"
312,895109,898060,,and that semester abroad in Norway all over again.
313,898062,899611,,"Oh, come on, Amy."
314,900447,902364,,You don't get it.
315,902366,904116,,Look at this brain.
316,904118,906952,,I don't really want to.
317,906954,909154,,This is us.
318,909156,911156,,"Bernadette, you are the analytical,"
319,911158,912858,,scientific left hemisphere.
320,912860,916044,,"Penny, you're the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere."
321,916046,918297,,And where's Amy?
322,918299,920866,,She's right here-- the sad little tumor
323,920868,923469,,no one wants to go dress shopping with.
324,925972,927673,,"Amy, you're not a tumor."
325,927675,930058,,"Penny, tell her she's not a tumor."
326,930060,931927,,(retching)
327,938050,940652,,(phone ringing)
328,940654,943388,,Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell
329,943390,945252,,"invented the telephone,"
330,945277,947989,,"he proposed answering it with ""ahoy""?"
331,949529,951747,,Ahoy.
332,952782,955501,,I like it.
333,955503,958036,,Amy? Is that you?
334,958038,960205,,Have you been drinking?
335,960990,963842,,"I'm sorry, I bet my sweet what?"
336,964878,967513,,"Well, all right. We're on our way."
337,967515,969214,,What's going on?
338,969216,973886,,It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot.
339,973888,975354,,Really? Amy?
340,975356,977139,,"Leonard, be glad you can't keep a woman."
341,977141,978607,,They are a handful.
342,985648,987032,,"Oh, look."
343,987034,988767,,It's Sheldon and little Leonard.
344,988769,991203,,"Hi, little Leonard."
345,991205,993405,,"Hi, Amy."
346,993407,995040,,"Hey, Cuddles."
347,995042,997209,,Cuddles?
348,997211,998994,,"Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled."
349,998996,1000412,,"Grow up, Leonard."
350,1002749,1005000,,"Amy, what are you doing here? - Well,"
351,1005002,1007219,,I came here to get a bottle of wine
352,1007221,1010121,,like Penny taught me to do when you're sad.
353,1010123,1013805,,"Yeah, but why didn't you go back to your apartment?"
354,1013810,1015144,,"Didn't you go to high school, Leonard?"
355,1015145,1018313,,Parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out.
356,1018315,1021800,,Not that the rat bastards ever invited me.
357,1021802,1023352,,Maybe we should get you home.
358,1023354,1025303,,"Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. Sheldon,"
359,1025305,1029024,,"what would it take for you to go into that liquor store,"
360,1029026,1030609,,"buy a bottle of hooch,"
361,1030611,1033061,,"take me across the street to that motel,"
362,1033063,1036164,,and have your way with me?
363,1037867,1040869,,"Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?"
364,1043322,1046425,,"I'm begging both of you, please, let's go."
365,1046427,1047843,,Okay.
366,1047845,1049327,,Come on.
367,1049329,1051046,,Upsy-daisy. - Whee!
368,1051048,1053682,,"Ooh, finally someone found second base."
369,1058521,1060589,,I know how you feel.
370,1060591,1064893,,"I got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe, too."
371,1064895,1066177,,(knocking)
372,1066179,1067896,,Hi.
373,1067898,1069180,,What do you want?
374,1069182,1071617,,Do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back?
375,1071619,1074786,,I never gave you a friendship bracelet.
376,1074788,1078457,,"When we first met, I made one and pretended you gave it to me."
377,1078459,1080509,,You can have it back if you want.
378,1080511,1085263,,"No, you made that for you; I want   to have it."
379,1086532,1088750,,"We know you're upset, and you have every right to be,"
380,1088752,1091136,,"but if it's okay with you, we'd like a second chance"
381,1091138,1092203,,to make things right.
382,1092205,1093772,,"PENNY: We are really sorry,"
383,1093774,1096425,,and we were trying to think of some way to show you
384,1096427,1097893,,how much we care about you.
385,1097895,1098927,,BERNADETTE: Which is why
386,1098929,1100896,,it would mean so much if you would agree
387,1100898,1102931,,to be the maid of honor at my wedding.
388,1102933,1106401,,"What? Wait, is this some kind of practical joke?"
389,1106403,1108570,,"Like in Norway, when my ""friends"""
390,1108572,1111773,,trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?
391,1114661,1118330,,No. I-I want you to be the maid of honor.
392,1118332,1119948,,"Oh, my gosh."
393,1119950,1122668,,No one's every asked me to be the maid of honor before.
394,1122670,1123952,,"Well, that's not true."
395,1123954,1126672,,"Once, but then they all died."
396,1127874,1130258,,So is that a yes?
397,1130260,1132294,,(laughs): Yes. Yes.
398,1132296,1133962,,"Oh, my gosh,"
399,1133964,1135297,,I-I have so much to do.
400,1135299,1137683,,There's the bridal shower and the bachelorette party.
401,1137685,1139468,,What should we do for the bachelorette party? (gasps)
402,1139470,1142587,,"Oh, I know-- we'll go to a Native American sweat lodge,"
403,1142589,1144272,,"we'll take peyote, roll around in the mud,"
404,1144274,1146391,,and paint fertility symbols on Bernadette's naked body.
405,1146393,1147943,,So that's happening.
406,1147945,1150062,,"Yeah, sure, sure."
407,1150064,1152647,,"Vegas is fun, too."
408,1152649,1153699,,I feel like crying.
409,1153701,1155367,,"Of course, I could just be hormonal."
410,1155369,1158286,,"Oh, wait. Maybe our menses are finally syncing up. Bernadette?"
411,1158288,1159955,,No? Penny?
412,1159957,1161573,,Sorry. - Really?
413,1161575,1162541,,"Okay, yeah."
414,1162543,1163792,,Yay!
415,1173155,1174956,,Maid of honor Amy Farrah Fowler's
416,1174958,1177542,,"amazing behind-the-scenes wedding video,"
417,1177544,1179227,,take one.
418,1180462,1182330,,We're just trying on dresses--
419,1182332,1184532,,do we really need to record this?
420,1184534,1187335,,"I'm sorry, are   the maid of honor?"
421,1188453,1190471,,I   the bride.
422,1190473,1193174,,So no. And action.
423,1194276,1195943,,What do you think?
424,1195945,1197612,,I love it!
425,1197614,1199380,,"AMY: What are you, a nun?"
426,1199382,1203251,,"Come on, bestie, let's see some skin."
427,1203253,1205653,,BERNADETTE: Amy! Looking sexy!
428,1205655,1207939,,You think they don't have mirrors in there?
429,1207941,1210307,,I know how I look.
430,1215113,1216697,,Oh...!
431,1216699,1219417,,"Bernadette, you look beautiful!"
432,1219419,1221983,,AMY: You do. - Thank you.
433,1221984,1224125,,"Not Penny beautiful, but beautiful."
434,1226842,1228809,,"AMY: Come on, bestie, you're up."
435,1228811,1230461,,PENNY: Give me a minute.
436,1230463,1233297,,What is taking you so long?
437,1233299,1235332,,"Oh, Amy! Get the hell out of here!"
438,1235334,1237635,,"Sorry, sorry. (groans): Oh, God."
439,1237637,1239186,,Amy! - Sorry.
