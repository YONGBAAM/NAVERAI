155,401080,402379,,"You know, i-it's just that"
156,402381,404298,,I'm not that comfortable with little kids.
157,404300,406383,,"Well, that's because you haven't been around them much."
158,406385,408135,,"This is good practice. I mean,"

161,411941,414257,,"Yeah, sure. Oh-ho-ho!"

164,420449,422783,,"You let everyone see the pan is empty,"
165,422785,426403,,but there's a secret compartment in the lid.

172,454567,456317,,Had a rough night.
173,456319,459987,,I thought I'd go for a walk and clear my head.
174,461773,465442,,Some people go outside and do that.

177,473085,474918,,You want to talk about it?
178,474920,476036,,No.
179,476038,478222,,I think I'll just go in this saloon

181,485597,489833,,You know digital alcohol is never a solution.

187,506185,508202,,Did you and Amy get in a fight?
188,508204,512189,,Amy had a fight; I was being perfectly reasonable.
189,513041,514241,,I'm gonna have a whiskey.
190,514243,515325,,Do you want anything?
191,515327,517644,,"No, I can't."
192,517646,520531,,I'm playing Grand Theft Auto later.
193,525503,528055,,"Look, I'm no expert in women..."
194,528057,528922,,I'll say.
195,530275,533060,,That's not necessary when someone's trying to help you.
196,533062,535312,,I'm sorry. It's the alcohol talking.
197,535314,537614,,Go on.
198,538850,543220,,Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them
199,543222,548358,,and then show them that you can grow and change.
200,548360,554731,,Nuts to that. What else you got?
201,554733,555949,,Buy her something.
202,555951,559670,,How does that work?
203,559672,563457,,"Well, you skip over any attempt to repair"
204,563459,566510,,your emotional connection and you win back her affection
205,566512,570080,,with an empty financial gesture.
206,570082,574902,,"Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it."
207,575937,577921,,Glad I could help.
208,577923,579589,,It's appreciated. And if you ever manage
209,579591,582643,,"to find a woman again, I'll be glad to return the favor."
210,585480,588649,,"And now, all the rings are"
211,588651,591034,,magically linked together.
212,592303,595873,,"My fiancee's wearing a magic ring, too."
213,595875,598392,,It made all my money disappear.
214,601112,603280,,"Oh, ah, right."

228,646759,648008,,It's a fake pitcher.
229,648010,649676,,You got wax in your ears?

232,655167,660187,,"Okay, we're going to stick this in here."
233,660189,663006,,And then I'm going to pour in the milk.
234,663008,665142,,"(chuckles): I hope this works,"
235,665144,667211,,because I didn't bring a change of pants.
236,667862,669780,,"Look, I Googled it."
237,669782,671882,,It's a fake pitcher.

280,795887,799439,,than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.
281,799441,802392,,"Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you"
282,802394,805095,,when I say stupid stuff.
283,807398,808915,,"Ooh, a pocket watch."
284,808917,810900,,"Okay, I don't think Amy wants a pocket watch."
285,810902,814788,,"No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch."
286,814790,818875,,Still saying stupid stuff.
287,818877,820794,,Ooh...
288,820796,821845,,Does she like bracelets?
289,821847,824131,,"Well, she's very fond of her silver one"
290,824133,826049,,"that says ""allergic to penicillin."""
291,826051,829436,,Maybe they have a dressier version of that?
292,829438,831388,,"Well, how are we doing this afternoon?"
293,831390,832856,,Are we looking for anything special?
294,832858,834307,,Perhaps a ring for the lady?
295,834309,836610,,"(snorts) Trust me, we are not a couple."
296,836612,838528,,Excuse me.
297,838530,841531,,I don't see why you get to snort derisively and point that out.
298,841533,844367,,You'd be lucky to land a fella like me.
299,844369,845819,,"Fine, go ahead."
300,845821,849573,,"(snorts) Trust me, we are not a couple."
301,849575,850624,,My apologies.
302,850626,852292,,How can I help you today?
303,852294,853660,,He's in trouble with his girlfriend
304,853662,855212,,and needs to buy her a present.
305,855214,857798,,"Great, trouble with girlfriends"
306,857800,861051,,is what's putting my daughter through USC.
307,863087,865555,,"Ooh, are these real diamonds?"
308,865557,869059,,"Yes. Channel set baguettes, 20 points total weight."
309,869061,870644,,Remarkable.
310,870646,873013,,"Diamonds, crystallized carbon."
311,873015,875131,,"Every day, people go to the grocery store"
312,875133,877184,,and come home with sacks full of carbon
313,877186,878968,,in the form of charcoal briquettes
314,878970,881571,,that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire.
315,881573,883990,,But just because you've got some carbon
316,883992,885992,,"with the atoms stacked neatly,"
317,885994,888662,,you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars.
318,888664,890280,,"Actually, that's only 750."
319,890282,891531,,Everything's on sale.
320,891533,894734,,Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch.
321,897205,900207,,I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it.
322,900209,901491,,I always
323,901493,904377,,thought I'd be a dad someday.
324,904379,905662,,"Oh, me, too."
325,905664,907097,,You're so caring.
326,907099,910634,,I've often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood.
327,914689,916056,,"There you go, Howard."
328,916058,919359,,Sounds like Raj'll have your babies; problem solved.
329,919361,921478,,"Hey, just because a man shows caring for another man"
330,921480,922779,,doesn't mean he's displaying the love
331,922781,925782,,that dare not speak its name.
332,927969,929852,,Did she definitely say she didn't want kids?
333,929854,931655,,"Yeah, she doesn't like them."
334,931657,934991,,"And from what I saw, the feeling was mutual."
335,939997,941864,,What are you gonna do?
336,941866,943099,,I don't know.
337,943101,945702,,I can't see a life where I don't have kids.
338,945704,947254,,"I mean, people have kids."
339,947256,952375,,"I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr."
340,952377,956680,,So he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses
341,956682,960617,,and throw barrels at Italian plumbers.
342,960619,964220,,"You know, there's no guarantee even if you have kids"
343,964222,965906,,that you're going to like them.
344,965908,969025,,"Wow, that's rough. Where'd you get that?"
345,969027,973330,,It's right off the dust jacket of my mom's last book.
346,975499,979836,,Maybe me and Bernadette aren't right for each other.
347,979838,984040,,"Look, Howard, I'd say there's a lot of fish in the sea,"
348,984042,987010,,but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years.
349,987012,989646,,Do not throw her back.
350,992216,996353,,"I don't want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker."
351,996355,998521,,What's your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?
352,998523,999856,,"Oh, it'll kill her."
353,999858,1001808,,"On the other hand, if I don't give her grandchildren,"
354,1001810,1003226,,"that'll kill her, too."
355,1003228,1005946,,"So, either way, on the Mom front, I'm golden."
356,1008482,1011067,,What time did you tell Amy to be here?
357,1011069,1012986,,8:00.
358,1017441,1020243,,"Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous."
359,1020245,1021444,,Nonsense.
360,1021446,1024147,,I look like a train conductor.
361,1025967,1029169,,Under what pretext did you lure her here?
362,1029171,1032339,,"(knocking) I said, ""Hey, want to come over and hang out?"""
363,1032341,1034307,,"Good, good, if you had said something clever,"
364,1034309,1036509,,she might've gotten suspicious.
365,1037311,1039729,,Hey. Hi.
366,1039731,1040963,,What's he doing here?
367,1040965,1042649,,"Okay, he wants to talk to you."
368,1042651,1044401,,"Well, I don't want to talk to him."
369,1044403,1046469,,"And I'm pretty disappointed in you, too."
370,1046471,1050073,,Although we both know that won't last.
371,1050075,1052742,,"Sheldon, you're up."
372,1052744,1053743,,Thank you.
373,1053745,1056746,,"Amy, I'd like to apologize."
374,1056748,1059082,,Your accomplishment was impressive.
375,1059084,1062252,,And I'm proud of you.
376,1065056,1066790,,We both know that's your koala face.
377,1066792,1068041,,I told you.
378,1069460,1071628,,"Okay, look, he bought you this."
379,1071630,1074097,,Jewelry?
380,1074099,1075498,,Seriously?
381,1075500,1077384,,"Sheldon, you are the most shallow,"
382,1077386,1079269,,self-centered person I have ever met.
383,1079271,1081671,,Do you really think another transparently manipul...
384,1081673,1083506,,"Oh, it's a tiara!"
385,1083508,1085174,,A tiara! I have a tiara!
386,1085176,1087677,,"Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me,"
387,1087679,1090947,,"put it on me, put it on me, put it on me."
388,1093401,1095235,,You look beautiful.
389,1095237,1097320,,"Of course I do, I'm a princess, and this is my tiara!"
390,1107214,1109883,,"You were right, the tiara was too much."
391,1115911,1118590,,MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard! Bernadette's...
392,1118591,1122426,,"Oh, she slipped right by me."
393,1122428,1123978,,Here's your vest back.
394,1123980,1125363,,You should keep it.
395,1125365,1127231,,You could wear it again sometime.
396,1127233,1128482,,Where?
397,1128484,1131986,,"I don't know, hunting?"
398,1131988,1133987,,MRS. WOLOWITZ: Don't forget to talk to
399,1134012,1135312,,her about this
400,1135408,1137491,,where I don't get grandkids!
401,1139294,1140294,,"Don't worry, Ma."
402,1140296,1142380,,"I will, as soon as I can figure out a way"
403,1142382,1145082,,to bring up such a sensitive issue!
404,1148253,1150972,,"I guess you talked to your mom, huh?"
405,1150974,1152456,,I was upset.
406,1152458,1154959,,"My mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on,"
407,1154961,1158763,,if the smell of Bengay doesn't burn your eyes.
408,1158765,1162650,,"Look, it's obvious having kids is really important to you,"
409,1162652,1165519,,and I think I came up with a solution.
410,1165521,1167054,,(laughing): Really?
411,1167056,1168573,,That's great. What?
412,1168575,1172577,,"Well, seeing as how I make way more money than you anyway,"
413,1172579,1175496,,what if I work and you stay home with the kids?
414,1175498,1177815,,Me? Yeah.
415,1177817,1179750,,"You know, you'll watch"
416,1179752,1181586,,and pull Cheerios out of their noses
417,1181588,1183153,,"and go on play dates,"
418,1183155,1184922,,and I'll work and have conversations
419,1184924,1188559,,with people my own age and enjoy my life.
420,1191263,1192597,,Yeah...
421,1192599,1195549,,"Yay, so we're good."
422,1195551,1198886,,"Yeah, we're good."
423,1198888,1202139,,"You know, I don't know if this counted as a fight,"
424,1202141,1204942,,but how about some make-up sex?
425,1204944,1206277,,I would love that.
426,1206279,1209280,,But what is that behind your ear?
427,1209282,1211015,,"Oh, look, it's a condom."
