2,7362,9529,,"MAN: Hey, Howard. Dave Roeger here at NASA."
3,9531,11814,,We need to talk about your upcoming mission.
4,11816,15835,,"Yes, yes, I've been doing my push-ups."
5,15837,18955,,"I'm still stuck at nine, but..."
6,21158,24961,,...that's going all the way down with no one holding me.
7,24963,27464,,"That's great, uh, but that's not why I called."
8,27466,29599,,We've run into a bit of a snafu.
9,29601,32101,,"Your Soyuz capsule failed the pressurization test,"
10,32103,35688,,"so bottom line, mission's been scrubbed."
11,37441,40543,,You're kidding. So what does that mean?
12,40545,43480,,Uh-huh.
13,43482,45231,,Uh-huh. (laughs)
14,45233,47250,,"Boy, I got to tell you,"
15,47252,48902,,I'm really disappointed.
16,48904,50370,,This was my dream
17,50372,53490,,ever since I was a little kid.
18,53492,55241,,"Okay, well, uh,"
19,55243,57277,,thanks for the call.
20,57279,59963,,"Yep, you, too."
21,59965,61697,,Yes! Thank you!
22,61699,65201,,(laughs): Oh! Oh...
23,65203,67554,,I'm not gonna die in space!

37,105696,108665,,SHELDON: I'm going to need a larger shirt.
38,111886,114254,,This one's a little tight under the arms.
39,114256,115722,,Okay.
40,115724,117090,,Do you think maybe it's tight
41,117092,118558,,because you're wearing long underwear?
42,118560,120744,,"Yes, of course that's why it's tight."
43,122513,123980,,"All right, let me rephrase the question."
44,123982,125682,,Why are you wearing long underwear?
45,125799,127165,,You're kidding.
46,127167,130201,,Shouldn't the question be: why   you?
47,130203,134689,,"No, it should be: why are you? (sighs) Leonard,"
48,134691,136858,,these rental tuxedos have been
49,136860,138993,,worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers.
50,139789,141973,,"I don't like my own sweat touching my skin,"
51,141975,144125,,how do you think I feel about theirs?
52,144910,146828,,Why don't you slip this on?
53,146830,148963,,Said the hangman offering a noose.
54,150199,151916,,"Well, that wasn't as entertaining"
55,151918,153618,,"as when he rents bowling shoes,"
56,153620,155537,,but it was right up there.
57,155539,157689,,"Well, that's it."
58,157691,159457,,My orders have been rescinded.
59,159459,161826,,"I am officially ""no go"" to space."
60,161828,164045,,"I'm sorry, Howard, but I got to tell you,"
61,164047,166014,,I'm a little relieved you're not going.
62,166016,167164,,Why?
63,167166,169166,,"Come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket"
64,169168,171302,,designed in the 1960s by the Russians.
65,171304,172637,,"Yeah, so?"
66,172639,174639,,When was the last time you were at Best Buy
67,174641,176841,,"and you heard someone say, ""Ooh, check out this Blu-ray player,"
68,176843,179227,,"it must be good, it was built in Russia""?"
69,181063,183398,,"Well, their technology isn't that bad."
70,183400,186734,,"When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule, you free-fall"
71,186736,188703,,"from space at 500 miles per hour,"
72,188705,190705,,and the only thing that slows you down
73,190707,192490,,is a little parachute that pops out
74,192492,194208,,right before you crash into the ground.
75,194210,195693,,And the whole thing was designed
76,195695,198246,,by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture
77,198248,200331,,Rocky and Bullwinkle.
78,201750,203367,,"All right, well, whatever."
79,203369,204586,,I wasn't worried.
80,204588,205720,,You weren't?
81,205722,209340,,Let me explain the difference between you and me.
82,209342,210725,,(sighs) You watch
83,210727,213311,,I live it.
84,215230,217565,,"Oh, please. I don't remember the episode of"
85,217567,219183,,where the guy never goes to space
86,219185,221886,,and brags about it in a tuxedo store.
87,221888,223271,,"Make all the jokes you want,"
88,223273,225389,,but there's only one of us here brave enough
89,225391,227742,,to almost do what I almost did.
90,227744,230895,,"SHELDON: Ah, much better."
91,233282,235166,,You must be burning up.
92,235168,237669,,A little. But not more than your urethras
93,237671,240622,,will be after whatever's in those pants swims up them.
94,243125,244459,,Well...
95,244461,248179,,"I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don't I?"
96,248181,252433,,I look like the Flash about to get married.
97,254470,256220,,Oh! A tissue! A tissue!
98,256222,257639,,"Oh, good Lord!"
99,257641,259857,,"Uh, where's he going?"
100,259859,262226,,He keeps emergency Purell in the car.
101,262228,263778,,Keys! Keys! Keys!
102,267933,269484,,"Hey, you. Before I come in,"
103,269486,272770,,"you should know, I have gas."
104,272772,276124,,"For the record, not your worst opening line."
105,276126,278026,,Check it out. It's the gas I use
106,278028,280294,,in my free-electron laser to support high voltages.
107,280296,283581,,it also has an interesting secondary use.
108,283583,285166,,(gas hissing)
109,285168,286751,,Here. Breathe this in.
110,286753,290621,,"B-Before I do it, if you're a cop you have tell me, right?"
111,290623,292640,,Just try it.
112,292642,293808,,Okay.
113,293810,295343,,(inhales)
114,295345,297645,,(very deep voice): What's it supposed to...
115,297647,299630,,"Oh, my God, that's so freaky!"
116,299632,301599,,(laughs)
117,301601,303134,,(inhales)
118,303136,305436,,(very deep voice): ¢Ü You're a mean one ¢Ü
119,305438,307739,,¢Ü Mr. Grinch. ¢Ü (laughs)
120,307741,309607,,"Okay. Me, me, me. Ready?"
121,310576,313411,,"(very deep voice): Leonard, I am your father."
122,313413,315980,,(both laughing)
123,315982,317915,,I have never been more attracted to a woman
124,317917,319667,,who sounds like a man in my life.
125,319669,321452,,Oh... (laughs)
126,322320,323538,,Mm.
127,325290,327842,,Hey... you know how we've been...
128,327844,330712,,taking things slow? Mm-hmm.
129,330714,332597,,"Well, I've been thinking, and..."
130,332599,334498,,maybe I'm ready to...
131,334500,336884,,take things a little... faster.
132,336886,338386,,Oh...
133,338388,339554,,great. Mm-hmm.
134,339556,341639,,"And I promise, after waiting four months,"
135,341641,344959,,fast is what you're gonna get.
136,345844,347511,,"You know, just-just one thing."
137,347513,349397,,"Look, we're in a really great place right now,"
138,349399,350698,,and I don't want to do anything
139,350700,352366,,that will make stuff all weird again.
140,352368,354235,,So we won't let it get weird.
141,354237,355653,,"Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up..."
142,355655,357855,,"mm, since the last time you saw me naked,"
143,357857,359490,,I got a Cookie Monster tattoo.
144,359492,362126,,The acceptable responses when you see it
145,362128,363828,,"are ""awesome"" or nothing."
146,363830,365997,,What about...
147,365999,367865,,(very deep voice): Cookies!
148,367867,369050,,(laughs)
149,369885,372136,,(balloon sputters)
150,373188,374972,,(knocking) SHELDON: Amy?
151,374974,376257,,(knocking) Amy?
152,376259,378509,,(knocking) Amy?
153,380045,381729,,"7:00, right on time."
154,381731,384098,,It's not an accident.
155,384100,386717,,I waited outside your door for 20 minutes.
156,386719,388903,,"Well, dinner's almost ready."
157,388905,390321,,"I must say,"
158,390323,391889,,I was surprised you chose to spend
159,391891,393407,,our date night in your apartment.
160,393409,394776,,"As I mentioned,"
161,394778,399063,,"the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times,"
162,399065,402366,,"and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale."
163,402368,403734,,"You ask anyone,"
164,403736,405119,,that's a hot date.
165,405121,408172,,"Tempting choices, but I have something special"
166,408174,409406,,planned for tonight.
167,409408,411075,,What can be more special than having
168,411077,413377,,an adequate amount of time to cross the street
169,413379,416914,,on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?
170,416916,419350,,"With our friends moving forward in their relationships,"
171,419352,422553,,I've decided that we should make progress in ours as well.
172,422555,424605,,"Oh, dear Lord."
173,424607,427358,,"Two years ago, we didn't even know each other,"
174,427360,430611,,and now I'm in your apartment after dark.
175,431480,434431,,How much faster can this thing go?
176,434433,436234,,"I had a feeling you'd be reluctant,"
177,436236,438152,,which is why I'm going to dip
178,438154,439904,,into my neurobiological bag of tricks.
179,439906,443474,,"(laughs): Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away."
180,444326,445609,,I have devised
181,445611,447495,,an experiment that I believe will increase
182,447497,450047,,your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame.
183,450049,452283,,And how do you propose to do that?
184,452285,453584,,"Uh, hope you're not thinking"
185,453586,456170,,about some sort of LSD thought control.
186,456172,457421,,Because there's
187,457423,459640,,"only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys,"
188,459642,461625,,and that's called school.
189,461627,465263,,Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up.
190,465265,468349,,"In your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera."
191,468351,469466,,I'm going to attempt
192,469468,471819,,an experiment that will get you to transfer
193,471821,473487,,those feelings to me.
194,473489,474605,,"Well,"
195,474607,476240,,seems what's on the menu tonight
196,476242,479410,,is malarkey with a big side of poppycock.
197,479412,480912,,We'll see.
198,480914,484498,,"Let's start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?"
199,484500,487618,,(Super Mario Bros. video game music playing)
200,487620,489987,,Super Mario Bros. theme?
201,489989,491172,,Yes.
202,491174,493824,,I see what you're doing.
203,493826,495459,,You're attempting to build on the work
204,495461,496677,,of Ebbinghaus by triggering
205,496679,499630,,an involuntary memory of me playing that game--
206,499632,503184,,admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood...
207,504136,505269,,...but it won't work.
208,505271,507104,,Fine. There's no reason we still can't have
209,507106,509140,,a lovely dinner. Why don't you have a seat.
210,509142,511826,,(Sheldon humming along with song)
211,511828,513861,,Boink! Boink!
212,515314,517398,,May I offer you something to drink?
213,517400,518983,,You know I don't drink.
214,518985,520234,,Not even...
215,520236,521485,,strawberry Quik?
216,521487,523287,,(quiet gasp)
217,523289,525740,,I love strawberry Quik.
218,525742,528910,,"It's my favorite pink fluid,"
219,528912,531996,,narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol.
220,531998,534165,,"Oh, I know."
221,534167,535967,,I think it will go nicely
222,535969,537785,,with what I have prepared...
223,537787,539253,,for dinner.
224,539255,543257,,(gasps) Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!
225,543259,544429,,Just like your mommy used to make.
226,544454,545477,,Oh...
227,545478,548145,,"yummy, yummy!"
228,548147,551148,,We should do this more often.
229,557689,559824,,Uh-oh.
230,562077,563227,,"LEONARD: I'm sorry. I did,"
231,563229,564779,,I crossed a line. I didn't mean to!
232,564781,566664,,Who says something like that right in the middle
233,566666,568032,,"of sex?! I don't know,"
234,568034,570067,,it just came out. People say weird things
235,570069,571419,,during sex all the time.
236,571421,573788,,"Okay, well, they sure as hell don't say that."
237,573790,575456,,"It was the heat of the moment. No,"
238,575458,578075,,"the heat of the moment is, ""Ooh, yeah, just like that,"""
239,578077,580861,,"not ""will you marry me?"""
240,581746,583097,,I'm sorry.
241,583099,584799,,Just-just give me another chance.
242,584801,586600,,"Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go,"
243,586602,588102,,"""Hey, baby, want to go look for houses"
244,588104,590888,,"in neighborhoods with good schools?"""
245,590890,593107,,"Again, I'm sorry."
246,593109,595359,,"You know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married,"
247,595361,597761,,I got caught up in a little wedding fever.
248,597763,599397,,I take it back. You can't
249,599399,600648,,take something like that back.
250,600650,603100,,"I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?"
251,603102,605820,,"Okay, at some point, we'll look back"
252,605822,608990,,and this is going to be a funny story.
253,608992,611442,,Why don't we just start doing that now?
254,611444,613294,,You're kidding. No.
255,613296,616464,,"Hey, do you remember..."
256,617582,620217,,...that time when I proposed
257,620219,623087,,to you in bed? (laughs)
258,623089,626590,,"And you were all, like, ""What are   doing?"""
259,626592,627558,,(laughs)
260,627560,629727,,That was so funny.
261,630612,633798,,So funny.
262,633800,635099,,It's not funny.
263,635967,638085,,Give it a minute.
264,638887,641772,,Is that a little smile I see there?
265,642474,645259,,I should go.
266,646478,648195,,"Hey, I was thinking."
267,648197,650147,,"For our first dance at the wedding,"
268,650149,654035,,what if we learn the final number from
269,654037,656454,,"You're kidding. No,"
270,656456,657821,,come on.
271,657823,659273,,How cool would that be?
272,659275,663194,,Me running into your arms...
273,663196,665496,,you lifting me up into the air.
274,666831,669266,,"Oh, you're in a good mood."
275,669268,670634,,"Yeah, well, why wouldn't I be?"
276,670636,673054,,"You know, I'm marrying the girl of my dreams,"
277,673056,674805,,and I finally got my mother to agree
278,674807,677224,,not to come on our honeymoon.
279,678009,680344,,"(phone rings) Oh, hang on."
280,681196,682396,,"Oh, it's NASA."
281,683565,684899,,Wolowitz.
282,684901,687802,,"Oh! Hi, Dave. What's up?"
283,689321,691872,,No kidding. Really?
284,691874,693023,,"Well,"
285,693025,696660,,that's... great news.
286,696662,699530,,"Great, great news."
287,699532,701916,,"All right, I'll watch my e-mail"
288,701918,704301,,for the details.
289,704303,706470,,"Okay, talk soon."
290,707906,709006,,What's so great?
291,709008,712309,,It looks like I'm going into space after all.
292,712311,713594,,(nervous chuckle)
293,713596,716180,,"Oh, Howie, that's wonderful!"
294,716182,718349,,"Uh-huh, wonderful."
295,719267,722770,,(shakily): Yay...
296,728552,730136,,What happened? I thought
297,730138,732305,,they canceled your mission. Th-They did.
298,732307,734507,,But NASA really wants
299,734509,736893,,"my telescope up on the space station,"
300,736895,739762,,so they're putting me on an earlier launch.
301,739764,741764,,When? A...
302,741766,744066,,week from Friday.
303,744068,746936,,What? We're getting married that Sunday.
304,748005,749171,,You're right!
305,749173,750806,,I-I can't go to space.
306,750808,753309,,"I have to get married, and no one can say"
307,753311,755661,,that's not a good reason. I'll call him back.
308,757698,759332,,Wait. I don't want to be
309,759334,761150,,the one who stands in your way.
310,761152,762985,,"Well, too bad, you already did. It's a done deal."
311,762987,765087,,"Oh, well. But I forgive you."
312,765089,767323,,"No. That's not how I want to start our marriage,"
313,767325,768708,,killing your dream?
314,768710,770626,,We'll have the wedding when you get back.
315,770628,772128,,But wh-what about
316,772130,775197,,all the plans and the guests?
317,775199,776299,,We'll call them.
318,776301,778267,,Although my dad's gonna go a little nutso
319,778269,780353,,over losing his deposits.
320,780355,784273,,"You're right, he is!"
321,784275,786025,,Your dad's gonna be furious.
322,786027,788861,,(chuckling): There's no way he's gonna let us postpone this wedding.
323,788863,790296,,"Well, we tried."
324,791698,792949,,I'll talk to him.
325,792951,795517,,He won't say no to his little girl. No!
326,795519,798354,,"I-I should talk to him,"
327,798356,799822,,man to man. (sighs)
328,799824,801657,,"But, Howie, my dad can be a bully."
329,801659,803659,,He's gonna make you cancel your space flight.
330,803661,804994,,(chuckles) We can only hope...
331,804996,807113,,that he doesn't.
332,808332,812534,,"Bishop to queen four,"
333,812536,814236,,level two.
334,814238,816172,,Check.
335,816174,817840,,Sheldon...
336,817842,819475,,knight takes bishop.
337,820060,821344,,You all right?
338,821346,823512,,I'm fine.
339,824514,825648,,Are you?
340,825650,827883,,"You left your queen exposed from above,"
341,827885,829602,,"you trapped your knight in the corner,"
342,829604,833122,,"and you keep sighing and saying, ""Why me?"""
343,833124,834774,,(sighs)
344,834776,836275,,Very well.
345,836277,839395,,Can I ask you a question about women?
346,840364,842698,,We got you that book last year.
347,842700,844583,,Wasn't everything in there?
348,844585,848537,,"No, I'm having a relationship problem with Amy."
349,848539,849505,,"And by the way,"
350,849507,851824,,that book gave me nightmares.
351,851826,854627,,"Well, if it makes you feel any better,"
352,854629,857380,,I screwed things up pretty good with Penny.
353,857382,859882,,"Look at us, Leonard..."
354,859884,862685,,engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching
355,862687,864804,,about their ol' ladies.
356,864806,866939,,I guess we are.
357,866941,869775,,"So, what's going on?"
358,869777,871427,,"Believe it or not,"
359,871429,873863,,Amy has embarked on a campaign
360,873865,879768,,to increase my feelings for her by making me happy.
361,879770,883823,,"I'm sorry, that must be very difficult for you."
362,883825,885825,,It's awful.
363,885827,887827,,"This morning, she arranged for me"
364,887829,890446,,to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day.
365,890448,891580,,It-It's usually
366,891582,892798,,only open to children.
367,892800,895801,,She got them to make an exception.
368,895803,898220,,Shame on her.
369,898222,901173,,"They let me blow the whistle, Leonard."
370,901175,904293,,She's good.
371,904295,905227,,I know.
372,905229,906929,,it gets worse.
373,906931,908814,,Her efforts are causing me
374,908816,911133,,to have affectionate feelings for her
375,911135,914270,,at inappropriate times.
376,915405,919075,,"You mean, like in bed or in the shower?"
377,919077,920409,,No!
378,920411,923662,,Would you please stop referencing that infernal book?
379,924815,926782,,"For example, this morning,"
380,926784,929034,,I was calculating the random motion
381,929036,931003,,"of virtual particles in a vacuum,"
382,931005,933839,,when suddenly the particles morphed
383,933841,937376,,into an image of Amy's dandruff...
384,940647,942264,,...gently cascading down
385,942266,946001,,"onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders."
386,946003,947486,,(groans)
387,947488,950606,,"What has that vixen done to me, Leonard?"
388,950608,952374,,And how do I make it stop?
389,952376,954743,,"Well, if you had a physical relationship,"
390,954745,956612,,I'd say propose during sex.
391,956614,959932,,Turns out that's a real mood killer.
392,959934,961700,,I assume we're talking about you now?
393,961702,962685,,Yeah.
394,962687,963852,,"So, that's how this works?"
395,963854,966188,,"I complain, and then you complain,"
396,966190,968857,,and no one offers any solutions?
397,968859,971694,,Pretty much.
398,971696,974863,,"Well, no wonder the women are winning."
399,977033,978334,,(knock)
400,978336,980836,,"Mr. Rostenkowski, are you busy?"
401,980838,983539,,"Oh, just looking at some old pictures. Come on in."
402,983541,985090,,"Family pictures, or...?"
403,985092,988377,,"H-Holy crap, that's a dead person."
404,988379,991564,,Last murder case before I retired.
405,991566,993599,,How many bodies do you see there?
406,993601,994717,,"Careful,"
407,994719,997086,,it's a trick question.
408,997088,999271,,I'm not sure.
409,999273,1000656,,"Nah, you'll never get it."
410,1000658,1003442,,It's a fraction.
411,1003444,1005611,,How about that.
412,1005613,1006745,,"Anyway,"
413,1006747,1009231,,"sir, I need to talk to you about something."
414,1009233,1010332,,(cracking)
415,1010334,1012001,,Walnut?
416,1012003,1013702,,"No, thank you."
417,1013704,1015037,,I'm allergic.
418,1015039,1016738,,"Oh, sure."
419,1016740,1019091,,My partner used to have that.
420,1019093,1020742,,He's dead now.
421,1022295,1023762,,From nuts?
422,1023764,1025447,,"Nah, his wife shot him."
423,1026266,1030202,,"But she was nuts, so in a way..."
424,1031188,1032471,,Nice story.
425,1032473,1034139,,"Anyway,"
426,1034141,1036592,,the reason I wanted to talk to you is
427,1036594,1039278,,NASA has moved up my launch
428,1039280,1041530,,to the International Space Station.
429,1041532,1043365,,"Yeah, so? So..."
430,1043367,1045868,,the date is going to conflict
431,1045870,1047903,,with me marrying your daughter.
432,1047905,1050105,,"Now, I know what you're going to say-- I made"
433,1050107,1052124,,a commitment to Bernadette and to your family
434,1052126,1054109,,and I've got a hell of a lot of nerve
435,1054111,1056328,,coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing.
436,1056330,1057997,,"Well, message heard and understood."
437,1057999,1059632,,Mission canceled. Thank you.
438,1061117,1062251,,Where are you going?
439,1062253,1064053,,I'm sorry.
440,1064055,1066589,,May I be excused?
441,1066591,1068090,,"No, you may not."
442,1068092,1069475,,Let me tell you something.
443,1069477,1071393,,When I first met you...
444,1071395,1072794,,You just gonna stand there?
445,1072796,1076649,,"I'm sorry, I didn't know, is this going to..."
446,1076651,1077766,,"Well, I should sit..."
447,1077768,1079485,,"May I be seat... Well, I'll just sit."
448,1081438,1083956,,"When I first met you,"
449,1083958,1085507,,I didn't like you.
450,1085509,1088944,,"I'm aware of that, sir."
451,1088946,1091947,,But then you and I had some time together.
452,1091949,1092981,,Uh-huh.
453,1092983,1095834,,It did not get better.
454,1095836,1098187,,"Right, right."
455,1098189,1100289,,That silly Beatle haircut
456,1100291,1101490,,and...
457,1101492,1103542,,"you riding around on a red Vespa,"
458,1103544,1106428,,and you're still living at home with your mother.
459,1106430,1109465,,"To be honest, I thought Bernadette chose you"
460,1109467,1111267,,to punish me.
461,1112769,1115671,,"But then I heard about your astronaut thing,"
462,1115673,1117273,,and I realized
463,1117275,1119475,,I judged you too fast.
464,1119477,1120809,,Maybe you are
465,1120811,1122728,,the right guy for my little girl.
466,1122730,1125064,,"Oh, I am. And just so you know,"
467,1125066,1128233,,"I'd still be an astronaut, even if I didn't go to space."
468,1128235,1132288,,I've got an I.D. card and a NASA golf shirt.
469,1132290,1133706,,"No, no, you got to go."
470,1133708,1135991,,You can't turn down an opportunity like this.
471,1135993,1138360,,B-But what about the wedding
472,1138362,1141080,,and all the money you put down for the reception?
473,1141082,1142965,,You let me worry about that.
474,1142967,1144783,,"You go up to that space station,"
475,1144785,1146986,,and you make me proud.
476,1151424,1152658,,"Um, okay."
477,1152660,1153759,,(laughs)
478,1153761,1155711,,You got a problem with that?
479,1155713,1158213,,"All right, look, I'm gonna level with you."
480,1158215,1161550,,I'm terrified about going into space.
481,1161552,1165154,,What if I don't make it back?
482,1165156,1168741,,"It's gonna be okay, son."
483,1168743,1171143,,You really think so?
484,1171145,1173045,,Of course.
485,1173047,1175681,,A pretty girl like Bernadette...
486,1175683,1178150,,she'll find a new guy.
487,1190031,1191214,,Hey.
488,1191216,1192516,,Hey.
489,1192518,1193717,,Off to work?
490,1193719,1194852,,Yeah.
491,1194854,1196186,,Have a nice night.
492,1196188,1197888,,"Okay, you, too."
493,1198707,1200223,,"Penny, just, wait."
494,1200225,1202109,,I've been thinking about what I said
495,1202111,1204178,,when we were in bed the other night.
496,1204180,1206280,,"Yeah, I've been thinking about it, too."
497,1206282,1208716,,I noticed you never answered me.
498,1210335,1212503,,You're right.
499,1216341,1218509,,No.
500,1220762,1222880,,"Uh, follow-up. Are we still dating?"
501,1222882,1224247,,PENNY: Yep.
502,1224249,1225966,,Is it still weird 'cause I proposed?
503,1225968,1227668,,Yep.
504,1227670,1229603,,I have a couple more quick questions.
505,1229605,1230827,,Do you want to call me from the car?
506,1230852,1232852,,No!
507,1234225,1236860,,Think I played that pretty well.
508,1238196,1240430,,(electronic whirring)
509,1240432,1243233,,(electronic whirring continues)
510,1246988,1248572,,(whirring stops)
511,1249758,1251775,,"Hello, Leonard."
512,1251777,1252910,,What are you doing?
513,1252912,1255312,,We're playing doctor.
514,1255847,1259199,,style.
515,1260018,1263454,,"I'm in hell, Leonard."
516,1263456,1264955,,Don't stop.
