0,7030,8631,,It's from
1,8945,10177,,What do you think?
2,10179,12080,,I don't know.
3,12082,14816,,If we're going to start a fantasy sword collection--
4,14818,17819,,and I've long thought we should--
5,17821,20020,,is this really the sword to start with?
6,20022,21739,,What did you have in mind?
7,21741,26077,,"Well, off the top of my head, I'd have to go with Excalibur."
8,26079,28863,,It gives you the right to rule England.
9,28865,31666,,It would be a replica of a movie prop.
10,31668,33835,,Fair enough.
11,33837,37255,,It'd give you the right to rule a replica of England.
12,37257,39557,,"Well, they don't have an Excalibur here,"
13,39559,41259,,so what do you want to do?
14,41261,43945,,Mm. Tough decision.
15,43947,46564,,There's no weaponry from
16,46566,50050,,forged in a Chinese sweatshop?
17,50052,53154,,Just Bilbo Baggins' sword over there.
18,53156,57742,,Two grown men with a hobbit's dagger; wouldn't we look silly?
19,59611,60895,,"Okay, let's go for it."
20,60897,62914,,"Oh, I see you guys have"
21,62916,64015,,found my little treasure.
22,64017,65783,,Yeah.
23,65785,67118,,"It's okay, I guess."
24,67120,68736,,Okay? It's magnificent.
25,68738,70505,,Buh-buh-buh-buh!
26,72341,73908,,What do you want for it?
27,73910,76177,,"Oh, it's hard to put a price on something"
28,76179,78830,,that's a copy of something that was on pay cable.
29,79798,82216,,"But for my friends, let's say 250?"
30,82218,84469,,"Oh, that's pretty steep."
31,84471,85536,,"Well, it's a limited edition."
32,85538,88773,,"They only made 8,000 of these bad boys."
33,88775,90224,,"Only 8,000?"
34,90226,92360,,We're wasting precious time. Buy it.
35,92362,94195,,Hang on.
36,94197,96263,,Can you do any better?
37,96265,97565,,Are you kidding?
38,97567,99317,,I'm already giving you the friends and family discount.
39,99319,100451,,"Oh, did you hear that?"
40,100453,101953,,We're getting the friends and family discount.
41,101955,104388,,We are honored and we will take it.
42,104390,105606,,Slow down.
43,105608,106908,,Two hundred.
44,106910,107909,,What are you doing?
45,107911,109660,,250 is already the discounted price.
46,109662,111579,,Will you shut up?
47,111581,112747,,"Tell you what, I'll go 235."
48,112749,114165,,Nope. Maybe another time.
49,114167,116067,,"Okay, 225-- my final offer."
50,116069,118753,,"Take it, take it."
51,118755,120588,,Two hundred.
52,120590,122340,,"Man, you're killing me!"
53,122342,124725,,Killing you? I can't breathe.
54,125394,127828,,"210, and I'm losing money."
55,127830,130681,,"Oh, now, we can't let him lose money, Leonard. I'm so sorry."
56,130683,133851,,210 and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.
57,133853,135019,,Are you crazy?
58,135021,136654,,That helmet's signed by Robert Downey Jr.
59,136656,137855,,So?
60,137857,139640,,"Okay, if you're going to question"
61,139642,142210,,the importance of an actor's signature on a plastic helmet
62,142212,144111,,"from a movie based on a comic book,"
63,144113,147848,,then all of our lives have no meaning!
64,150869,152420,,"Okay, fine."
65,152422,153754,,"Just the sword, 210."
66,153756,155323,,Thank you.
67,155325,156791,,I can eat meat this week.
68,158710,159710,,See that?
69,159712,161012,,I just saved us 40 bucks.
70,161014,163347,,"I've long said, what you lack in academic knowledge"
71,163349,166050,,you make up for in street smarts.
72,166052,167167,,You want me to wrap it?
73,167169,168168,,"No, it's okay."
74,168170,170021,,I'm gonna stab my friend in the chest.
75,171139,173057,,"Hey, Stuart."
76,173059,174125,,"Ah, hey, Wil."
77,174127,177445,,"Hello, Wil Wheaton."
78,177447,179363,,"Hi, Sheldon."
79,179365,180398,,Nice sword.
80,180400,182400,,It's part of my sword collection.
81,182402,184819,,Do you have a sword collection? - No.
82,184821,187738,,I'm not surprised.
83,187740,190207,,Here's the Batman 612
84,190209,192710,,with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted.
85,192712,194579,,Awesome. What do I owe you?
86,194581,195379,,40 bucks.
87,195381,196414,,Good deal.
88,196416,197715,,Sucker.
89,197717,200251,,Didn't even ask for the friends and family discount.
90,200253,202053,,"Hey, I'm having a party at my house on Friday,"
91,202055,203537,,and I was hoping you would stop by.
92,203539,204805,,Will there be girls there?
93,204807,205756,,"Yeah, of course."
94,205758,209093,,'Cause there wasn't last time.
95,209095,212063,,There will be girls.
96,212065,214765,,You guys are invited if you want to come by.
97,214767,216383,,Thank you.
98,216385,217384,,"All right, great."
99,217386,218903,,Later.
100,220772,222556,,I see what you're doing.
101,222558,224241,,You accept an invitation
102,224243,226460,,"to a party at the home of my sworn enemy,"
103,226462,228195,,"he tells everyone we're going to be there,"
104,228197,230064,,"and when we don't show, he looks the fool."
105,230066,231449,,Fiendishly clever.
106,232951,234619,,I was actually thinking about going.
107,234621,237838,,And then declaring the party a fiasco
108,237840,239674,,"and storming out, leaving him humiliated"
109,239676,241092,,in front of his guests.
110,241094,243060,,Love it.
111,243062,246998,,"No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time."
112,247933,249884,,"Oh, great, more guys."
113,249886,253354,,It's gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage-fest.

127,284561,286194,,"It's not that simple, Leonard."

132,294238,298657,,"Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton's party,"

137,311138,312421,,Of course.
138,312423,314706,,"Now get it yourself, you traitor."
139,316542,319761,,"Wait, what is going on?"
140,319763,321146,,"In case you have forgotten,"

142,322716,324215,,"No, no, I didn't forget."

144,327154,328987,,it's either dead or alive or both.
145,329906,331573,,"Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck"
146,331575,334242,,"in my brother's camp trunk, and we did not need to open it"
147,334244,336862,,to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.

149,339900,341249,,and a bosom that defies it.
150,341251,343201,,"You're the whole package, aren't you?"
151,345171,347039,,Sorry I'm late.
152,347041,348840,,"Uh, I got great news."
153,348842,350959,,NASA picked my team's design
154,350961,353578,,for the deep field space telescope that's going on
155,353580,355297,,the International Space Station this spring.
156,355299,357132,,(all murmur excitedly)
157,357134,358734,,"Howie, that's wonderful!"
158,358736,359735,,Congratulations!
159,359737,360936,,It gets better.
160,360938,363105,,Someone has to go up with the telescope
161,363107,367859,,"as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is."
162,367861,370462,,Muhammad Li.
163,371263,373598,,Who's Muhammad Li?
164,373600,376401,,"Muhammad is the most common first name in the world,"
165,376403,378036,,"Li, the most common surname."
166,378038,379538,,"As I didn't know the answer,"
167,379540,381873,,I thought that gave me a mathematical edge.
168,381875,384109,,"It's me, Sheldon."
169,384111,385010,,It's me.
170,385012,386444,,I'm going up in space!
171,386446,388613,,"Technically, I'm an astronaut."
172,388615,390499,,(all murmur excitedly) That's amazing!
173,390501,392117,,(chuckles) Hang on a second.
174,392119,394002,,NASA doesn't have a shuttle anymore.
175,394004,395954,,How are you going to get up there?
176,395956,397089,,"Oh, well, it's really cool."
177,397091,399141,,"You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan,"
178,399143,401977,,and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you
179,401979,403311,,into a low earth orbit.
180,403313,405931,,Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia
181,405933,408016,,sold the rocket fuel on the black market.
182,410103,412270,,Are those Russian rockets safe?
183,412272,414689,,"Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built"
184,414691,416858,,by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl.
185,418745,421146,,I'd like to propose a toast.
186,421148,423815,,"The dream to go up into space is one we all share,"
187,423817,426084,,and Howard's making that a reality.
188,426086,427536,,We're all very proud of you.
189,427538,429004,,ALL: Cheers.
190,430489,431706,,That was a lovely toast.
191,431708,433008,,Kudos. Thank you.
192,433010,434960,,"Simultaneously, a festival of cloying cliches."
193,434962,437012,,You sicken me.
194,444720,446188,,You're really quiet.
195,446190,447839,,Is everything okay?
196,447841,449891,,Fine.
197,452195,454613,,Just a little tired.
198,454615,456848,,"I hope not too tired, because I'm feeling"
199,456850,459184,,particularly masculine right now.
200,460403,463354,,"All systems go, if you catch my drift."
201,463356,466958,,I always catch your drift.
202,466960,469795,,"All right, well, something's obviously bugging you."
203,469797,470996,,What is it?
204,470998,473048,,I just can't believe you signed up
205,473050,475300,,for the space program without even talking to me.
206,475302,478336,,"Oh, I get it."
207,478338,480639,,You're worried about me.
208,480641,482424,,That is so sweet.
209,482426,487979,,"You know, there's a saying we have at NASA."
210,490149,493218,,What makes the right stuff so right
211,493220,496271,,is that it always comes home.
212,497773,500075,,"Just stop talking, Howard."
213,501911,503495,,This isn't the reaction I expected
214,503497,505897,,when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.
215,505899,508283,,What did you think was going to happen?
216,508285,510452,,Honestly? Sex.
217,512288,513905,,Howard.
218,513907,515924,,Do you realize what a big deal this is?
219,515926,519678,,What an honor it is to be chosen to go into space?
220,519680,521079,,"Yeah, I get it."
221,521081,523381,,I just wish you included me in the decision.
222,523383,525416,,We're supposed to be partners.
223,525418,527352,,We're supposed to be a team.
224,529222,531139,,I'm sorry. You're right.
225,531141,534693,,"Okay, let's try this again."
226,534695,538363,,"Bernadette, an opportunity has come up"
227,538365,543318,,"that impacts both of us, and I'd like to discuss it."
228,544820,546604,,Okay.
229,546606,549107,,I've been offered a chance to go up
230,549109,553111,,to the International Space Station for three weeks.
231,553113,554963,,What are your thoughts on that?
232,554965,558049,,"Well, first of all, thank you"
233,558051,560919,,for including me in the decision-making process.
234,560921,563305,,"Hey, we're a team."
235,563307,564306,,(chuckles)
236,564308,565840,,"So, what do you think?"
237,565842,567642,,No.
238,568477,569728,,No?
239,569730,571513,,No.
240,571515,574733,,Why not?
241,576485,579654,,"Howard, my father was a police officer."
242,579656,581806,,We never knew from one night to the next
243,581808,583742,,if he was going to come home alive.
244,583744,585160,,It was horrible.
245,585162,588246,,And I don't want to live that way with you.
246,590866,597172,,"Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11."
247,597174,599424,,We never saw him again.
248,599426,601826,,"Oh, boo-hoo, you're not going to space!"
249,606665,609634,,"Pretty cool about Howard, huh?"
250,609636,611770,,Don't talk to me as if nothing's happened between us.
251,611772,613188,,"And yes, it sure is, buddy."
252,616142,618727,,"For God's sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff."
253,618729,620946,,Would you prefer a simpler application
254,620948,622397,,"of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle,"
255,622399,623448,,in which I could either
256,623450,625700,,"know where you are or whether I like you,"
257,625702,627352,,but not both?
258,627354,630555,,"You never stop talking, do you?"
259,632024,633708,,I don't understand.
260,633710,634826,,What differences does it make

262,636363,638747,,Wil Wheaton is Sheldon's mortal enemy.
263,638749,639914,,Mortal enemy?
264,639916,641716,,"Mm-hmm. Sheldon, I know you're a bit"
265,641718,643251,,"of a left-handed monkey wrench, but..."
266,643253,647038,,you really have a mortal enemy?
267,647040,649391,,"In fact, I have 61 of them."
268,650226,652177,,Would you like to see the list?
269,652179,654145,,"Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no."
270,654147,655914,,You just got off the list.
271,655916,657816,,Would you like back on it?
272,658651,661052,,This'll just take a moment.
273,661054,664322,,It's on a five and a quarter inch floppy.
274,670363,671579,,A floppy disk?
275,671581,675166,,"Well, I started the list when I was nine."
276,675168,677402,,How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?
