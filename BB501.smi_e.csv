4,17098,18547,,(laughs)
5,18549,21434,,It's-It's not what it looks like.
6,24555,27073,,What does it look like?
7,29076,32778,,It's not what it looks like.
8,33630,37617,,It's not what it looks like.

10,39287,42505,,Penny's brain teaser this morning.
11,42507,44123,,She and Koothrappali

16,57805,61607,,"If I could, I would, but I can't, so I shan't."
17,61609,63809,,"Now, knowing Penny,"
18,63811,66979,,"the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus."
19,66981,68531,,But...
20,68533,70266,,"since that's what it looked like,"
21,70268,73519,,we can rule that out.

27,90121,91721,,Mm-hmm. The procedure

29,93474,95341,,"until the subject is asleep,"
30,95343,97944,,and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air.
31,103967,106269,,"Yes, just like that."
32,107454,109238,,Penny could have been
33,109240,111741,,inspecting Raj's anal region for parasites.
34,111743,113276,,"Oh, boy."
35,113278,115328,,That's a true blue friend.
36,115330,119332,,"They slept together, Sherlock."
37,119334,121367,,"No, you weren't listening."
38,121369,124787,,She said it's   what it looks like.
39,124789,127206,,She lied.
40,130077,132295,,Oh.

61,199896,202046,,"That sounds like sarcasm,"
62,202048,204081,,"but I'm going to disregard it,"

77,233379,235746,,to think of me as just a regular Joe.
78,235748,238282,,This might take some thought. As you were.
79,238284,240051,,What the hell is wrong with you?

81,241721,244255,,What is it to you? - I got his back.
82,244257,246123,,"Yeah, right. You're just jealous because it turns out"
83,246125,247624,,I'm Penny's number two choice after Leonard.

89,260523,261806,,"You're dating my sister,"
90,261808,263574,,and Penny and I are in love.

108,311289,312689,,"Besides, you have nothing to worry about,"
109,312691,316527,,because now I'm the dusky half of Koothrapenny.

282,750899,753149,,You can't ruin a friendship with sex.
283,753151,757170,,That's like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.
284,758706,759706,,Come here.
285,759708,762041,,Just listen to me.
286,762043,764661,,I want to go back to the way we were before.
287,764663,766329,,"You know, friends."
288,766331,768465,,No sprinkles.
289,770334,773036,,Oh.
290,773038,774137,,All right.
291,774139,776506,,Thank you.
292,776508,778624,,(sighs)
293,778626,780593,,"Well, uh... (clears throat)"
294,780595,785482,,"as your friend, you might like to know that, um..."
295,789236,794190,,we didn't have sex in the conventional sense.
296,797628,799662,,"Oh, God."
297,799664,803082,,Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?
298,803084,805585,,"No, no."
299,807154,809822,,"After we got undressed and jumped in bed,"
300,809824,812375,,you-you asked if I had protection.
301,812377,813760,,"Oh, you did, didn't you?"
302,813762,815678,,Of course. I'm always packing.
303,815680,817714,,"Anyway,"
304,817716,820666,,"um, I had trouble putting it on"
305,820668,823937,,and you tried to help and...
306,827391,829792,,that was all she wrote.
307,834665,836482,,"So, we didn't actually..."
308,836484,837483,,I did.
309,837485,839502,,It was beautiful.
310,843523,844741,,Oh!
311,844743,846192,,"Penny, please, please promise me"
312,846194,847660,,you won't tell anybody about this.
313,847662,849195,,"Of course I won't. No, I won't."
314,849197,851164,,"Oh, good. (exhales)"
315,851166,852932,,"Um, can I tell people that our love"
316,852934,854217,,burned too bright and too quickly?
317,854219,857036,,"Kind of a ""Candle in the Wind"" deal?"
318,857038,858087,,Sure.
319,858089,859806,,Cool. Can I say it fell apart
320,859808,861874,,"because you were all, ""I want to have your babies"""""
321,861876,865028,,"and I was like, ""I'm too rock and roll to be tied down""?"
322,866547,867597,,No.
323,867599,871568,,Can I say I ruined you for white men?
324,873404,876189,,Also no.
325,876191,877407,,"Okay, just the candle thing."
326,877409,879558,,Yeah.
327,879560,881277,,Cool.
328,881279,883413,,All right... friend.
329,883415,884614,,Hmm.
330,884616,886899,,I'll see you around.
331,886901,887784,,Okay.
332,890237,891721,,"Raj, wait."
333,895742,898878,,Thank you for being my friend.
334,898880,900746,,Penny?
335,900748,901931,,Mm-hmm?
336,901933,903383,,It's getting beautiful again.
337,907087,909555,,"All right, this is a Google Earth view"
338,909557,911441,,of the field of battle.
339,911443,912692,,I don't see anything.
340,912694,914811,,Give it a second to load.
341,914813,916595,,"Whenever you're ready, AT&T!"
342,916597,919449,,"Okay, here we go."
343,919451,922035,,This is us here. To the south is Professor Loomis
344,922037,923403,,and the Geology Department.
345,923405,926239,,"According to their Twitter feed, they're out of sunblock,"
346,926241,930660,,which means they'll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma.
347,931378,932629,,That's our edge.
348,932631,935281,,"All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge,"
349,935283,936666,,the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards
350,936668,937950,,won't know what hit them!
351,937952,940136,,"All right, let's move out."
352,940971,943056,,"Hang on, Sheldon."
353,943058,946926,,How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?
354,946928,949345,,Maybe he was too busy writing clumsy penis metaphors
355,949347,951347,,about my fiancee.
356,951349,952482,,Screw you.
357,952484,955618,,That was a beautifully written penis metaphor.
358,958656,961524,,"You know what, guys, I'm not in the mood for paintball."
359,961526,963326,,What do you say we just bag it?
360,963328,965078,,"Fine with me. - Sure, whatever."
361,965080,966479,,You can't quit.
362,966481,968231,,That's a court- martial offense.
363,968233,970700,,That's punishable by...
364,970702,972618,,You can't quit.
365,972620,976339,,"Sorry, Sheldon, it's just not a good time for playing games."
366,976341,978657,,This is a game to you?
367,978659,981928,,"Uh, was the Battle of Antietam a game?"
368,981930,985048,,Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?
369,985050,988667,,"Yes, no and no."
370,988669,989969,,Wait.
371,991055,994774,,I just want you all to know that I forgive you.
372,994776,997393,,"This mutiny isn't your fault,"
373,997395,999345,,it's mine.
374,999347,1001531,,I haven't earned these bars.
375,1008355,1009906,,"Although what I lack in leadership,"
376,1009908,1013326,,apparently I more than make up for in sewing.
377,1013328,1015361,,"Let it go, Sheldon."
378,1015363,1017714,,I'll get you a Jamba Juice on the way home.
379,1017716,1018715,,No.
380,1018717,1022051,,Jamba Juice is for heroes.
381,1024088,1026372,,And that's what we're going to be.
382,1028092,1029425,,What are you doing?
383,1029427,1034713,,"Following in the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo."
384,1039570,1041771,,(people shouting in distance)
385,1047244,1051280,,Geology isn't a real science!
386,1051282,1054617,,(paintball guns popping)
387,1065012,1066512,,(popping ceases)
388,1067914,1071384,,Damn those sons of bitches!
389,1071386,1072935,,Let's get 'em!
390,1072937,1074753,,Eat paint!
391,1074755,1077390,,(yelling)
392,1079926,1081944,,"If there's ever a Church of Sheldon,"
393,1081946,1084597,,this will be when it started.
394,1084599,1085565,,(paintball guns popping)
395,1085567,1088251,,Ow!
396,1089369,1091103,,I'd like to propose a toast
397,1091105,1094707,,"to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory,"
398,1094709,1096459,,Captain Sheldon Cooper.
399,1096461,1097994,,"Hear, hear. Hear, hear."
400,1097996,1100830,,Excuse me. It's   Sheldon Cooper.
401,1101498,1102948,,"With my last breath,"
402,1102950,1106252,,I awarded myself a battlefield promotion.
403,1106854,1108387,,It's kind of a big deal.
404,1108389,1110173,,(knock on door)
405,1110175,1113142,,Hi. You guys have a minute?
406,1114728,1116962,,"Uh, yeah, sure."
407,1116964,1118598,,Okay.
408,1118600,1120233,,Um... (clears throat)
409,1120235,1122735,,"Well, I already talked to Raj, but I wanted to apologize"
410,1122737,1124020,,"to the rest of you for,"
411,1124022,1126906,,"you know, everything."
412,1126908,1128574,,"Please, Penny, let me. (clears throat)"
413,1128576,1133362,,"We've decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together"
414,1133364,1136082,,be just one of those memories you have
415,1136084,1138201,,and can call to mind when you're feeling blue
416,1138203,1140303,,or you're in the shower.
417,1142155,1144340,,"Hey, what you doing, Quick Draw?"
418,1150180,1151714,,Sorry. Go on.
419,1151716,1153349,,(clears throat)
420,1153351,1156135,,"Anyways, I wanted you guys all to know that I've been taking"
421,1156137,1159105,,a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion
422,1159107,1161023,,I have to stop kidding myself.
423,1161025,1163109,,I suck at acting.
424,1163111,1165778,,It's time for me to move back to Nebraska.
425,1165780,1167680,,You're leaving?
426,1167682,1168981,,Yeah.
427,1168983,1170950,,What are you going to do in Nebraska?
428,1170952,1173819,,"I don't know, maybe teach acting."
429,1173821,1174871,,(cell phone ringing)
430,1174873,1176789,,"Oh, sorry. Hold on."
431,1176791,1178241,,Hello?
432,1178243,1181026,,"Penny, listen, I hope you're not doing this 'cause of you and me,"
433,1181028,1183362,,"because I have a girlfriend, and you're a single woman..."
434,1183364,1184530,,"Shh! It's my agent, it's my agent."
435,1184532,1185831,,You're kidding.
436,1185833,1186799,,"Oh, my gosh."
437,1186801,1188634,,I can't believe it! Really?!
438,1188636,1189702,,"Oh, I'm so excited!"
439,1189704,1190670,,Thank you!
440,1190672,1191888,,Thank you so much.
441,1191890,1193172,,"Okay, bye."
442,1193174,1194674,,I got the hemorrhoid commercial!
443,1194676,1195858,,I start Monday!
444,1197895,1199595,,What about Nebraska?
